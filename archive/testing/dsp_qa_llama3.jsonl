Is this usually a good strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it is a good strategy... That said, I'm seeing here what I've seen on a lot of new sites: tag wikis and especially excerpts that give general-purpose definitions for the tag, without relating them to the site ! At best, this is... better than nothing. At worst, it's just noise. Here are some guidelines for writing tag wiki excerpts: The excerpt is the elevator pitch for the tag. You only have ~500 plain text characters for the excerpt, so don’t feel obligated to cover everything in it! Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences. Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized. The “email” tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone. Concentrate on what a tag means to your community. For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail, as that would be more appropriate for webapps.stackexchange.com. Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag. In other words, what kinds of questions should have this tag? Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions, so if we don’t provide proper guidance on which questions need this tag, they won’t get tagged at all, rendering the tag excerpt moot. Think of it as a sales pitch: in a room full of tags screaming “pick me!”, what would convince a question asker to select your tag? Some tags are common knowledge. Most tags require a bit of explanation in the excerpt, even if it’s only 3 or 4 words. But if the tag is common knowledge — that is, if you walked up to any random person on the street and said the tag word to them , and they would know what you were talking about — then don’t bother explaining the tag at all. Stick to usage of the tag within your community in the excerpt."}]}

Do we build up this list ourselves? If yes, what are some suggestions to put on there? I would think StackOverflow , Mathematics and Electrical Engineering should be on it. Any other ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, this can be done, but we'll first have to establish the site and graduate out of beta. Only then will a permanent migration path be established. Until then, that option is not available for users. The reason is that providing an option in the close menu is a way to let the community decide where to chuck it without a mod intervention. This is a very bad idea when a site is new and budding, because of a few reasons as below: With all the initial activity and excitement, people are overenthusiastic in shipping things off to other sites. This might not actually be the right thing to do because we're still defining what's on topic for us and to what extent questions marginally outside our bounds will be tolerated. Also, we need questions! Just because a question is more math/programming related doesn't necessarily mean it's on-topic there or a good quality question. The community has to grow to learn and understand which questions should be moved and which shouldn't. The golden rule of migration is \"don't migrate crap\". You can close questions with just 1 rep in private beta. This means that a user, who has no understanding of the SE system, can vote to migrate a question elsewhere, possibly flooding that site with questions that are possibly off-topic there. From what I've observed from other sites, a good number of the users who are active in the private beta and initial phase of public beta never make it to the end as dedicated users. We don't want good questions to be incorrectly shipped off by a small group of people w/o mod intervention, especially when the consensus of the larger community is yet unknown. Some sites never make it out of beta , so providing a migration path to this site might result in certain questions dying when the site is shut down. So migration has to be done carefully and selectively. So, the best thing to do right now is to flag it for a mod to migrate. In the initial days, the site is moderated by SE employees and they will not evaluate your flag unless a strong consensus builds up (i.e., a meta post with several in agreement or multiple flags). In a few weeks, they'll select pro-tem mods from the community who can gauge them better and they'll work with mods from the other sites in deciding if questions should be migrated."}]}

In addition, I peeked at some avid user's SE-network profile activities, and noticed that their activities come in bursts: 10+ days of silence, then 10+ good quality questions and answers on a few single days.

Combining those thoughts (or perhaps just my own subjective interpretation), I'm a little bit uneasy about going into public beta automatically - based on a pre-programmed countdown clock.

Usually the SE team evaluates the activity, quality of questions, and the number of active users (I don't think there are hard numbers for any of these) before opening up to the public. The one week of private beta is the absolute minimum that a site needs to be in before opening up. There is also precedence of this happening. Cryptography.SE stayed longer in beta not necessarily because of poor quality questions or low activity, but because the nature of the site was highly specialized and they felt that it might help if they waited a little longer for more questions and answers. Freelancers.SE also remained in private beta because of extremely poor questions and zero activity and was eventually shut down. However, I probably wouldn't do it the way you've described. Requiring a certain number of \"experts/researchers\" to register and participate is yet another barrier to the site's growth. What if they cannot fulfill this commitment now? They might've signed up a year ago when they thought they could, but things could've changed. What's more important during private beta is a good list of questions that will attract the experts outside, not necessarily answers.

And a couple from Proakis for good measure: pg. 2: A signal is defined as any physical quantity that varies with time,\n  space, or any other independent variable or variables. \n  Mathematically, we describe a signal as a function of one or more\n  independent variables. pg. 3: A system may be defined as a physical device that performs an\n  operation on a signal...When we pass a signal through a system, as in\n  filtering, we say that we have processed the signal...Such operations\n  are usually referred to as signal processing . -- Those quotes paint a pretty broad definition of the field.

People may not want to talk about, for example, biological systems here, but when it comes to modeling those systems to transform a signal, then it becomes much closer to the domain suggested by the references I cited. If we open ourselves up to too broad of a definition, it would defeat the purpose of the site, but if we restrict the definition too much, we may never get out of beta, and there won't be a site at all. In my humble opinion, it's probably reasonable, while we're still in beta , to favor a more permissive definition of signal processing--with the caveat that we try to use apparently off-topic questions to help define where we want to draw the line(s).  In other words, rather than completely rejecting the idea of say, a question about the saturation properties of the human eye, we encourage the OP to massage the question until there's consensus that it finally falls just within the boundary of what we're interested in talking about here. Or, more colorfully, we have to allow (or even encourage) people to paint outside the invisible lines in order to precisely determine where they are.

I envision this site to be a place for people to bring their research problems (from any field) that involve signal/image processing and get solutions or suggestions for them. There are several inter-disciplinary questions and the recent one on finding stomata in plant microscopy images comes to mind as a good example. The question on river detection in text is yet another great example of someone bringing their problem from a completely different field and asking the experts here if it could be done (and it got great answers!). Another good use of this site is in understanding algorithms used in certain applications (e.g. algorithm used in photoshop's B & W adjustment layer and explanations on fundamental but often misunderstood concepts (e.g., How are time resolution and frequency bandwidth related ). I really, really dislike the \"most lucid explanation to teach your grandmother to use wavelets\" kind of questions and I hope we don't see them very often. However, that's a different beast to tackle. What should be our policy? Ideally, algorithms, ideas and approaches should be first and foremost and not code in language X. I mean, the answerer can use whatever language they feel they're comfortable in (e.g., the river detection question had answers in MATLAB, python and Mathematica), but the focus of the question should not be an explicit \"give be the codez in X\". Questions like show me how in any language and I'll work it out myself are also most welcome here. Explicit requests for code in language X should be off-topic . The primary reason for not allowing questions that simply want code in X is because then we'll get overrun by which ever language is most commonly used in the particular field, and other folks who are more inclined towards theory and algorithm development part of it might be put off and leave. I can easily see MATLAB/openCV questions just flooding us if we opened the gates (in fact, we get a few such questions which you don't see because they are either promptly migrated or nuked right here). Can we have the best of both worlds? Coming to the question you linked to (electrophoresis gel), I in fact did comment on it and asked the OP if he was looking for code or approaches. He did seem pretty clueless, and looked like he wanted some code to solve his issue right away, so I left it at that. However, barring that, it fits very well with our site's scope and is a good example of the use of image processing in diverse fields. Ultimately, diversity is the key to our growth. So I decided to try something different. I requested that the question be left on Stack Overflow for a couple of days (a moderator did talk to me about your flag) and once the code part has been solved, I will request migration here, where users can provide an explanation of how to go about it in general. This way, the OP gets his problem solved, and we have a good resource for our site. I realize that our users might not have gotten the head start that Stack Overflow users would've gotten in terms of votes, and so I'm willing to put a bounty on every such question that I request for migration (only new questions), and does not have an already reasonable answer. I do not know if this will work or if it's a good idea, but I'm willing to give it a try. Since this was less than a day ago, I didn't have the time to bring it here as a meta post, but it's good that you did! I'd appreciate feedback on this idea. A final word on migrations... Please do not request for migration of old questions unless if it's really, really off-topic on Stack Overflow (or elsewhere) and a very good question for our site. Borderline and meager questions should be left alone where ever they are. If the OP of the post is not around anymore (greyed out) or hasn't visited in 2 years, please leave them where they are.

It probably takes me the same number of clicks to get to a tag wiki article as it does to a wikipedia article and I get less information! A tag wiki is supposed to educate users about the kind of questions you expect in the tag and perhaps what not to ask and if additional tags need to be used. The culinary uses tag on cooking.SE is a good example. It tells you what kind of questions use the tag, what kind of questions are not appropriate and has some tips on answering. apples and identification tags from gardening.SE are other examples that come to mind. If a tag becomes extremely popular, the tag could have its own collection of FAQ and tutorials like the scala tag on Stack Overflow. However, we have a long way to go before we get there. I'm not saying that the first iteration of the tag wiki needs to be perfect. However, I do think it needs to be more substantial than copy-pasta. The mistake was that we, the users who approved, fell into the trap of something is better than nothing . However, we'd rather have nothing than sloppy copies. Henceforth, I'll reject all cut-n-pastes, even if attributed. We can do better than that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are \"How do I do X in Y (programming language)?\" off-topic?\n\nContext:\nI just joined this site and was surprised to see that there is a matlab tag but not an OpenCV tag. I then found that we are already asking if OpenCV questions are off-topic . However, there seems to be no objection against these questions: How to provide region of interest (ROI) for edge detection and corner detection in Matlab? low pass filter and FFT for beginners with Python From my understanding, an answer on the OpenCV meta question suggests accepting questions about algorithms and rejecting those that care only about the implementation of an algorithm in a particular language. Without knowing much about the details, it seems like the Python question was asked as an implementation question but its accepted answer explains an algorithm. Therefore, Should we accept language-specific questions? If the answer is it depends , then when would a language-specific question be valid?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "See this answer for what I think of \"How to do X in Y\" questions. To quote: Ideally, algorithms, ideas and approaches should be first and foremost and not code in language X. I mean, the answerer can use whatever language they feel they're comfortable in (e.g., the river detection question had answers in MATLAB, python and Mathematica), but the focus of the question should not be an explicit \"give be the codez in X\". Questions like show me how in any language and I'll work it out myself are also most welcome here. Explicit requests for code in language X should be off-topic . The primary reason for not allowing questions that simply want code in X is because then we'll get overrun by which ever language is most commonly used in the particular field, and other folks who are more inclined towards theory and algorithm development part of it might be put off and leave. I can easily see MATLAB/openCV questions just flooding us if we opened the gates (in fact, we get a few such questions which you don't see because they are either promptly migrated or nuked right here). However, Jonas had a point that it should be OK for users to present their problem (with code if necessary) in whatever language they're using, as long as the approach is clear from their code (i.e., no brainfuck or golfscript like code). Further more, there will be no guarantees of an answer in that particular language, i.e., if someone knows a good algorithm and explains it via Mathematica/MATLAB/python for an OpenCV question, then it should be fine. It's up to the OP to translate it (they can always go to Stack Overflow for help with that). I think this is a very reasonable position and will help foster a language-agnostic culture, instead of the language-free culture we've been having up until now. Some examples of good, recent questions like this are: Surface detection Measuring length of DNA fibers from an image of single molecules Find the stomata in a plant microscopy image In both cases, the OP was looking for a solution in a particular language, but were both happy to learn of a possible approaches in different languages and I presume, are working on translating whatever helped. Coming to your examples, the first question should not have been asked here. It was originally asked on Stack Overflow , and Endolith, a good contributor to this site recommended dsp.se. However, I won't fault him for that, because the SO version looked more like a conceptual question, which would've been a good fit, whereas the OP decided to dump his code here. The answer barely passes the minimum characters required. I'll ship it back to SO sometime soon. The second one though, is very much on-topic. Note the last line: \"The result inverse contains complex values, that confuses me.\" That is the crux of the question. The rest is just to support the story. It is clear that the problem is a conceptual one and the OP merely provided his code to guide the question and perhaps confirm if his problem is with the code or with his understanding. These are actually the kind of questions that would be very interesting on this site. Couple of others with code/language in the question, but has a theoretical/conceptual answer is Why are there comb-like hills in a periodogram? What is the maximal frequency resolution for Matlab's STFT implementation spectrogram()?"}]}

The edit has basically altered two characteristics of the original response: Style of writing: \"But don't compute variance of a plain image, though! Better compute the variance of laplacian kernels\" \"( maybe with some stride to save time).\" I do not write like this. Clarity / Accuracy of Content Improvement by including a citation in the first paragraph which is inline with the guidelines. Unclear in terms of contribution on the point of variance of Laplacians to infer focus. A Laplacian can be seen as a high-pass filter. Obtaining the variance of the Laplacian provides an estimate of the 'smoothness' of high frequencies. The edited response now concludes with Of course, another way you could be judging the blurriness of an image is the ratio of the power of the high frequencies relative to the lower frequencies. In this case, instead of obtaining the standard deviation of each MxN window, you would have to obtain the 2D FFT. This is slightly more complicated though. . The point about \"slide the window in strides for quicker processing\" omits the impact this will have on the already high variance of the Laplacian. This is not how I would choose to talk about this subject. I think that the edits actually constitute a different response which could have been left as a separate answer, however the edits were accepted and the text, although attributed to me too, is not a response I feel 100% inline with. What is the general consensus about this? Should the \"severe editing\" limits be spelled out explicitly too? As a user, I was notified about the edit but I was only given one option, \"Approve\", which did not seem to be making a big difference anyway...(Whether I \"Approve\" or not, the edits were appearing), have I missed something here?

As for how to handle these situations in general, I'm not sure if there's an official protocol, but I'd be fine with people flagging approved edits for moderator review when they're in a grey area (i.e. \"in need of moderator intervention\"). Sometimes edits look reasonable and get approved, but if something is controversial to the OP, a second look should be warranted. As for the SE interface for edit notifications, I'm not sure if there's anything we can do about that.

That is why we are trying to make answers language-agnostic, as much as possible. It's better to \"teach the man how to fish\", and provide him with enough theory and explanation, so he can implement it in any language.\nThere are obviously some exceptions, and people tend to give examples in languages like: Python , MATLAB , C / C++ and R .

Such questions are far way better suited for Stack Overflow. Many DSP SE people have accounts on SO, so that DSP community over there is big enough to help someone. Your question kind of falls into the first category. You have a specific DSP/Machine Learning problem that you are trying to solve. In order to make it more suitable for DSP SE, you could state the problem differently. More precisely: \" How to detect number syllables in audio recordings \"? You shouldn't ask explicitly about R implementation. In my opinion, focus first on getting the right algorithm, then it should be a piece of cake to implement it.

Also, I tend to err on staying out of most questions.  I prefer the non-mod members answering, so that more recent members can accumulate rep. In general, short answers don't necessarily help the OP understand where their misunderstanding / error is.  I know @Olli is a good contributor here and has a great background in DSP, but many people asking questions here don't.  Those without the background find it harder to \"connect the dots\"; those with the background only see one dot, and not the smaller steps required to get there.

Due to this impression, these questions usually receive less attention. The best strategy (in my opinion) is to leave a comment asking for further improvements or adding more context to the question, to make sure the OP cares enough about what s/he has written. However, I don't think new users realize at the beginning that they should actually improve their question. Most often, the updates remain as a comment or two. Unfortunately, the process of getting familiar with the site (and how it works in general, including responding to the answers) is a slow and gradual one and new users don't know much initially. I also realized, some of the new users of dsp.SE are unregistered, which again causes this group of users being less responsible about their post (haven't seen this in Math.SE). Most of the questions are asked by new users. That's why there are several questions of this type. In case of no response, I think the usual approach is to put the question on hold."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can we get rid of and lock the [signal] tag?\n\nContext:\nOn a \"Signal Processing\" site, adding a signal tag to a question actually carries absolutely no information. Worse, even, is that most of the questions tagged with it are of mediocre-to-bad quality¹ (not surprising, since it shows the poster didn't take a step back to consider what tags would concisely describe his/her question) and that people seem to type things \"audio signal\" into the tag field and end up with audio signal . Since the existence of this tag alone allows people to just post questions without finding a better tag to use, I think the appropriate measure would be to not only remove the tag (manually, probably) from the 160-something questions that carry it right now, but also to blacklist it from being created again. Hence the question: Should we do that? Does the esteemed moderatorship agree? ¹ from the 155 non-closed, non-migrated, non-duplicate questions tagged with signal at the point of writing, we get this score histogram: which hopefully is a lot worse than the average tag's score histogram."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I agree.

This is still a relatively positive case, the exchange was short and they edited the question shortly after, but I've had exchanges over 20 and more comments with OP actively refusing to edit the question.

Having said that, there are already different ways to answer questions on DSP.SE:  If the question is a homework question (whether tagged as such or not), we tend to answer it differently from other questions. On the other hand, I reckon a significant percentage (more than 30%) of existing questions are by someone ... making money either as a software engineer or by applying what they learn to a signal / image processing problem. So, I think \"freeloading\" questions are on-topic, but should be approached with grain of caution."}]}

I'm having a deep rethink. Ced Follow up to Peter K.'s answer: \"That's the way we have always done it.\" is among the weakest policy rationales you can have.  I was truly expecting something more substantive, something I hadn't thought of, something that arose out of considered debate by knowledgeble parties. Discussion in the comments can be classified in five broad categories: 1) Clarification of the issues 2) Contention about the issues 3) Tangential Topics 4) Unrelated Topics (Tangents on tangents) 5) \"Meta\" talk For the first two, some of the third, and the last, the value of the discussion is greatly reduced when it is removed from its referential frame.  Only the fourth doesn't suffer from that. But they all suffer from a significant drop in likelihood of being read by shunting them off to a \"chat room\".  Yeah, I don't do \"chat rooms\", nor will I follow conversations to a chat room.  I am sure many others feel the same way. So yeah, it is discouraging when you have put a lot of thought into something, taken the effort to express it into just the right words for your intended recipient, to have it whisked away to somewhere it will rarely be seen, out of context if it is. (Likewise, it is discouraging when a newbie deletes a question and your carefully crafted answer along with it.) In my opinion, and it is broader than just for StackExchange, you will find the most valuable, and sometimes most entertaining, information in the commentary.  On news sites, I sometimes just skim over the articles and just read the commentary. Does StackExchange consider the commmentary valuable?  I think the fact that MathJax doesn't work in the chat room is a pretty good indicator that it doesn't.  It's a matter of preference so I can't say you are wrong, but I can certainly say I disagree. The discussion will often contain the key detail that an interested reader is missing for comprehension that does not get covered in the question or any of the answers. The rationale implicit in your answer is \"It makes pages too long and hard to follow.\"  I don't find that a problem as I am used to scanning through documents, but I recognize that is not true for all.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the units of $f/f_s$?\n\nContext:\nWhich is sometimes called the normalized frequency. Is it unitless? $$ \\frac{f \\; Hz }{f_s \\; Hz } = \\frac{f}{f_s} $$ Or not? $$ \\frac{f \\; \\frac{cycles}{second} }{f_s \\; \\frac{samples}{second} } = \\frac{f}{f_s} \\frac{cycles}{sample} $$ According to Dimensional Analysis, $ \\frac{cycles}{second} $ (aka Hz) and $\\frac{samples}{second}$ are both $sec^{-1}$ and the normalized frequency is dimensionless, so it is silent on the issue. The problem with that is the other common definition of normalized frequency has units of $ \\frac{radians}{sample} $ which is also dimensionless. Sampling is a repeated discrete task, it is not cyclical.  It has a rate, not a frequency. If I multiply the sampling rate by a time interval do I get cycles or samples? $$ N \\; samples  = f_s \\; \\frac{samples}{second} \\cdot t \\; seconds $$ I don't think I've ever seen someone say \"The DFT frame is 32 cycles long\", yet when you call the sampling rate a frequency that is what you are saying. So, can anyone give a justification for calling it sampling frequency other than ad populum.  And, if you can't, why should the deacons of a discipline (I'm talking about the regulars here) propagate a bad practice? This is more of a deepster question than it appears.  Please don't give a fired from the hip response.  Think about it a bit first. I've elaborated a little bit on this in a question: DFT exercise in the book Understanding digital signal processing 3 Ed Well, actually taking the point a little bit further.  I think it is damaging to teach the DFT strictly in the context of Seconds and Hertz as units.  One should not expect a first time learner to be able to differentiate the tool from its application.  There have been too many \"Where do I plug in the Hertz when looking for repeat patterns in ....\" (Paraphrasing). It doesn't help that most the used MATLAB calls seem to Hertz and Seconds oriented either. So, if you are an educator of this material, in any setting, please keep this in mind. Response to Fat32's comment in RB-J's answer. Actually I am coming at this form an epistemological direction.  I am well aware of the goal of DA (Dimensional Analysis) to achieve conceptual harmony to the natural physical constants (and approaching this goal is contrary to integrity checking of equations). My objection is to RB-J's role as an acolyte insisting that DA is \"the only and true way\" (and his combative manner).  Particularly since it was formalized by a \"standards committee\" (those with experience, insert running jokes here).  Whether rotation should be a dimension was and probably still is a big issue to wank over.  DA's definitions of \"Dimension\" and \"Unit\" are the pedantic ones and I would think minority ones.  The carrying-the-units/math/common man definitions are much more down-to-earth (more concrete than abstract).  A dimension is a coordinate in a vector space, and a unit defines a measure along that coordinate. So, if you want to use DA to find \"meaning in Physics\", fine.  But if you are looking for integrity checking to prevent calculation errors in formulas, you aren't using the best tool.  The lander crashed because \"velocity\" wasn't defined in units.  And I challenge you to assert the following equation is nonsense with the carry the units definition of a unit: $$ 2 \\frac{\\text{Semicircles}}{\\text{Circle}} \\cdot 1 \\frac{\\text{Circle}}{\\text{Cycle}}  \\cdot \\pi \\frac{\\text{Radians}}{\\text{Semicircle}} = 2 \\pi \\frac{\\text{Radians}}{\\text{Cycle}} $$ Two kilos of apples is different than two kilos of oranges, so if you are weighing them, I kilo of apples weighs a kilo (conversion factor), and I kilo of oranges weighs a kilo (conversion factor), so you can add them (common units).   Note, no need to mention dimension.  If you are counting them, well you have so many apples (units) and so many oranges (units).  If you want to compare items of different units, you have to convert them to the same scale (units) using what is known as a \"Value Function\".  The value function can be as simple as multiplying by a conversion factor (even if that factor is numerically 1).  \"Pricing\" is the most common value function there is.  Yes, carrying the units was developed mainly for use in \"rate problems\" to keep your units straight and it works well. The difference between carrying the units vs DA is like weak typing vs strong typing in programming languages. So, deepster/fancy question du jour:  If the Universe didn't exist, would the values of $\\pi$ and $e$ still exist? I hope everybody agrees that this is a definitional issue, so I'd like to attempt to take the \"my definition is right\" aspect out of this, and shift to the implications of accepting either definition as the correct one.  To do so, I'm going to introduce two working definitions with the intention that the scope not exceed the extent of the this question and its answers, and that the nomenclature not favor one over the other. t-units = Traditional units, using the root meaning of \"one\", capable of any level of specificity by the act of naming. s-units = Standardized units, as defined by the various ISO standards or other governing bodies There should be no disagreement about the following statements: s-units are a subset of t-units In t-units, the answer to the title question is cycles per sample In s-units, the answer to the title question is unitless Converting from t-units to s-units can be, and often is, lossy Three questions arise from these observations: A.  Should t-units be stamped out? B.  Was it the intent of standardization to weaken the integrity validation capability of Dimensional/Unit Analysis? C.  How does this relate to \"political correctness\" in general? Indeed, this is a pedantic (in a non-perjorative way) exercise, done in pedantic style.  That's the point of it being placed in Meta and tagged with \"discussion\". Okay, everybody can see the setup, right? Check-mate. Observation 4 validates Question B.  Question B is a yes/no question.  So what can be answered? No, it is an unintended consequence.  Okay, you admit that it is detrimental to integrity checking. Yes, it is intentional as it keeps things simple [A strong aversion to complexity has repeatedly been expressed here] and any loss of functionality is a small price to pay for the greater good of the benefits of standardization. In either case, it is clear that a loss of validity has occurred.  Therefore the answer to Question A has to be a firm no.  Furthermore, those who attempt to do so are firmly in the wrong and should desist immediately, starting with RB-J. Question C takes us to a whole 'nuther level.  This is totalitarianism in one of its many forms.  I will fight it where ever I see it.  This is called the \"good fight\". It is natural that engineers be attracted to technocracy, but you have to resist its siren song or you will surely crash on the rocks. I believe in the dignity of critters, including biped furless chimps.  It is institutions of all forms that need to have restrictive behavioral binds, not individuals.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "`stft` tag edit proposal\n\nContext:\nTo briefly comment on RBJ's The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is an analysis tool that repeatedly applies the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT or FFT) to short snippets of a longer signal, while sliding the window that selects the snippet of the longer signal that the STFT operates on. The STFT is a function of two independent variables, frequency in the DFT and the time of the center of the sliding window. I think \"repeatedly applies ... operates on\" should stand in its own sentence and  start like \"Its standard implementation\", and end with \"but it can also be done with strided convolutions\". That implementation also lacks a corrective step for some purposes. \"Windowed Fourier transform\" is one (and the more common) interpretation, but not the only one - more generally it's a time-frequency decomposition via complex bandpass filters. STFT also isn't exclusively discrete, and even then \"frequency in the DFT \" is too restrictive, even if not going with DFT freqs is a bad idea."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's an attempted update: The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is an analysis tool that\nrepeatedly applies the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT or FFT) to\nshort snippets of a longer signal.

I thought it was a good, if challenging question to ask. Because it was challenging, the OP was challenged. And, to my mind, the resulting discussion degenerated into a name-calling spat that was, er, unedifying to say the least. This prompted me, as moderator, to act and delete some of the name-calling comments. Apparently, I didn't delete all of them and that has upset the OP and probably others. I'm wondering what the community thinks about being civil? What does it mean for us?

The new revision is a rollback (includes cases where one selects to edit a prior revision and doesn't make any changes). The user does not have the remove new user restrictions privilege. During this period, any additional edits they make are collapsed into\nthe same edit in the revision history, displaying only the final\noutcome of all their edits within that 5-minute period.
