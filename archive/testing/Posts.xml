I had suggested a link to MFCC on Wikipedia in a comment but to see no improvement. If i put myself in the shoes of an expert, I feel extremely annoyed and repulsive to questions and answers like this. More over when i think of the up votes of these posts in this Q&amp;amp;A, i am worried where this site is heading to.&#xA;I'd appreciate your comments on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added :&lt;/strong&gt; (..in view of comment below)  The OP is seeking explanation of how a speech signal is represented by a feature vector. The most commonly used feature for speech recognition is MFCC, although there are many systems which use different types of features. The method of extracting the MFCC feature from speech signal is given in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstral_coefficient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; very clearly. In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/8/what-does-a-vector-in-a-hidden-markov-model-mean/24#24&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; the answerer starts with the tool called 'HTK' which is not relevant to the question directly and further does not bother to mention any reference or link to it. Then he goes on to say how speech recognition is carried on in brain and claims that it is very similar to that being done with this tool called 'HTK'. Here itself you can see how irrelavant it is to the particular question and he creates more chaos further in the answer by trying to explain the speech recognition method. It heavily lacks scientific method and is very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OP mentions in the question that he understands HMM based speech recognition to some extent, without knowing what a feature vector is ? I wonder to what extent he understands.&#xA;He does not mention any home work he did before asking the question. A HMM based speech recognition can use any type of feature vector and not necessarily MFCC, and if one has to answer this question he should presume it to be something which is popular and hence MFCC could be one choice.

Signal processing is a very diverse field and not everyone might be familiar with all acronyms (other than basic ones). I see an increasing trend of acronyms for all tags and it could get confusing eventually. Personally, I think descriptive tags are better than acronyms (which should be synonyms). However, we'd also run into tag length issues (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discrete-time-fourier-transform&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;discrete-time-fourier-transform&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;discrete-time-fourier-transform&lt;/a&gt; is 26 chars and only 25 are allowed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion is to use a hybrid of partial acronyms and partial descriptive names as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel-pca&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;kernel-pca&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;kernel-pca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discrete-time-ft&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;discrete-time-ft&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;discrete-time-ft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discrete-ft&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;discrete-ft&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;discrete-ft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/continuous-time-ft&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;continuous-time-ft&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;continuous-time-ft&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  when there is one among the group that will overflow and fully descriptive names in other cases as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hidden-markov-model&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;hidden-markov-model&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;hidden-markov-model&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fourier-transform&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;fourier-transform&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;fourier-transform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosine-transform&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cosine-transform&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cosine-transform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="77" LastEditorUserId="124" LastEditDate="2011-08-27T03:37:19.617" LastActivityDate="2011-08-27T03:37:19.617" Title="Order and consistency in tagging" Tags="|discussion|tagging|" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It's almost the kind where you'd want to jump on it to answer first and ride the upvote train.

So how to go about it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, (I actually want to ask about this but here is a preview), I want to ask about how &quot;Maximum Likelihood Estimation&quot; is used in the context of signal-processing.

But then from there, I would like to know when do us signal-processing tend to use it? What are its limitations generally speaking? When is it good to use it? When is it bad to use it? What are cursory topics related to it that improve it that one might be able to look into? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you see, I am looking for a 'stake in the ground' on the topic itself, but then some 'fan out' around it to get an idea of the lay of the land, and I am wondering what if any special formatting I need to do to make sure it is kosher for the sig-proc stack exchange.

  <row Id="1210" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2013-03-05T06:37:28.620" Score="8" ViewCount="196" Body="&lt;p&gt;For over a year (close to two years actually) this site has been growing, and quite a few members are taking an active part in both asking and answering the questions. As all of you (I'm sure) are aware, the Signal Processing Stack Exchange site is still in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1691/signal-processing&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; stage. If you're excited about the community and the effort everyone's been putting into keeping it active, helpful and relevant, perhaps we can all try and do a little more to help the site graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the first order of business, I'd like to point out that there are three categories in which we're doing &lt;em&gt;Okay&lt;/em&gt;, but not &lt;em&gt;Excellent&lt;/em&gt;. One of them is essentially amount of active Q&amp;amp;A traffic on the site, but that's not something we should be greatly concerned about since we are steadily growing, and are sure to achieve the critical mass one day. Two other things have to do with answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, only 86% of all asked questions have been answered, and we need over 90% to get to the &lt;em&gt;Excellent&lt;/em&gt; status, which isn't very far off at all. I therefore present everyone with the challenge of getting us all the way up there (and beyond). As an interesting data point, we actually &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; at 91% only several months ago, the the average number of questions per day increased over these months, while the number of answers has stayed approximately flat. Let's help change this statistic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you can do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Obviously, keep being awesome and post your answers to new questions. I've seen some really great responses out there. Keep it up!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since we've started falling behind a bit, it would be very helpful to go back and revisit some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/unanswered&quot;&gt;unanswered questions&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty out there that are well formed, but perhaps would take a little more time to answer. Others can have perfectly good shorted answers. There are all kinds of good unanswered questions out there, so please look through them and see where you can contribute.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you see a question which would benefit from more clarity, please comment and ask for more information. There are surprisingly many users on our site that don't have any experience with other Stack Exchange web sites, so we need to guide them an little at first in the art of forming good questions. This may help you or others to form good and meaningful answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attract more users to the site. I love bragging about this community, and I've gotten quite a few people excited about it online and in person. Some of them are now regular contributors. Spread the word, and help us attract more active membres.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm proposing a two-week challenge to get our answered questions rate back to above 90%! For those of you who are already active in answering questions, keep up the great work and please try to find some previously unanswered questions that you can tackle. For those of you who are more passive observers of this site, why not try and contribute some of your own brainpower to the world of signal processing Q&amp;amp;A?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you find an unanswered question which you can't address yourself, but that you think can be answered well by other members of the community, post it here in the response wiki to get other members' attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for making Signal Processing Stack Exchange a great community, and let's get serious about graduating to a full Stack Exchange web site.

Starting today, you'll receive the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will soon have an election for community-voted moderators - there is some backlog here as the elections for some of the first-wave sites have also had to be delayed. Elections for you and the other sites in this wave will start being scheduled in December.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will no longer see the &quot;beta&quot; label attached to your site's name&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will become eligible for question migration paths with the rest of the network&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will soon be able to select your own community ads.

These, too, will begin in December or early January so that you may enjoy the new changes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site will still receive a full design from one of our designers, which will be packaged with an increase in the amount of reputation needed to access each privilege.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to signal processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

To discuss about policies, feedback on questions (to close, etc.), tags, whatever...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several proposals follow (non-exclusive):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nyquist-shaped, every XXX day, to allow perfect sampling: might require a calendar with day indices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;week-shaped, every [XXXday] (Monday, Tuesday...): might not be convenient for people with an agenda (for instance not possible on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QC00oZ1q10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Friday, I'm in Love&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;month-shaped, every XXX^th day, the first, tenth, etc.: detrimental to February, but a little jitter can be beneficial&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;DSP-shaped (my favorite), &lt;strong&gt;every D.S.P. day (4th, 16th, 19th)&lt;/strong&gt;: D is the fourth letter, S, the 19th, P the 16th.  In a word, jitter plus irregular sampling. Two of them are powers of 2 (4 and 16), 19 is the 8th prime (and aside the maximum number of 4th powers needed to sum to any number), they are different modulo seven (4, 2 and 5).

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to signal processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to signal processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Had I not left it open a tab, I don't think I could have found it.  My answer had an &quot;undelete&quot; option available, which when I hovered the mouse cursor over it, says &quot;vote to undelete this post&quot;.  When I click it, it informs me that an answer to a deleted question can not be undeleted.  That makes sense, though I think the hover text should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I searched for the topic here on the meta forum.  I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1270&quot;&gt;similar question to mine&lt;/a&gt; with the answer containing a reference to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221&quot;&gt;deletion policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Had a second answer been added, or my answer upvoted, the user could not have deleted the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I put a bit of effort into the answer, and I am fairly sure I solved the issue for the OP.  I can speculate on why the user chose to delete the question rather than accept my answer, but it would be speculation.  The obvious tactic to thwart this is to add a second answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the rationale is for allowing a delete once a question has been answered?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ced&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Followup:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not read the Deletion Policy material closely enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the Deletion Policy link:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Deleting the question also deletes the answers. Deleting the answers undoes the hard work other people have put in to answer your question, and reverses the reputation they have earned too. This is not fair to the answerers of your question.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Peter K.'s comment Help link:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;(the standard prevention against deleting answered questions is there so answerers don't lose rep, &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the policy values any loss to the reputation of the answerers more heavily than the effort to put into providing an answer.  I think this is a poor decision as it provides a strong disincentive to put a large amount of effort into a first answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has only happened to me this one time, but still, it has left me feeling a little gun shy.  Should I wait until somebody else has posted an answer before I contribute mine?  Should I add a followup as a second answer instead?  Should I create a second account and upvote the first?  None of these remedies seem appropriate or appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess I've answered my own question to an extent.

My previous question to Meta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1563&quot;&gt;Deletion Rationale Clarification&lt;/a&gt;, seems to have concluded that the driving rationale behind the deletion policy was to preserve reputation points of the answerer over the effort they expended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.  The migration policy seems to be a stark constrast to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I answered a question in the DSP forum, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/47970&quot;&gt;What is the moment when all oscillators aligned to make a jump called? [migrated]&lt;/a&gt;, and my answer got an upvote and my reputation got a +10.  Then the question got migrated to the &quot;English Language &amp;amp; Usage&quot; forum.  Okay, since it was about finding the right word for something, that seems appropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when it got migrated, I lost the +10.  Not that big of a deal, but it could have been larger.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question remains in the question list with a [migrated] label at the end of the title.  When you click on it, you get redirected to the other forum.

That would seem to be the logical behavior for the system.  As it currently works, just like with the deleted case, I have no easy way of linking to that question.

That's the kind of thing I have in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might even end up being something as simple as a hashtag so that you can then create an RSS feed of those posts, or a DSP.SE chat room devoted just for this purpose (to avoid authentication, approval, etc) (?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1212" LastEditorUserId="1212" LastEditDate="2018-10-17T10:39:19.947" LastActivityDate="2018-11-30T12:46:56.720" Title="Proposing a collective DSP.SE curated resource" Tags="|discussion|" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The reason behind their stressful situation is unknown. But if the person is kept within the &amp;quot;stress region&amp;quot;, things are not going to become better for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is always the danger for someone to &amp;quot;play the game&amp;quot;. I do not have a citation for this, but I feel that this might be something innate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In toddlers for example, there is something called &amp;quot;Planned Ignoring&amp;quot; where, the carer figure ignores a behaviour of the child that the child uses to grab attention or achieve a goal. In that situation, there is something called the &amp;quot;Escalation trap&amp;quot;. The carer gets irritated because they perceive this action from the child as &amp;quot;pre-planned&amp;quot;, so they become firmer, the child then escalates their behaviour which leads the parent to either escalate or &amp;quot;give in&amp;quot;. (So what I am referring to &amp;quot;the game&amp;quot; here, is someone pretending to be distressed to get what they are after. Note here, I am not saying that they do it consciously, that they are evil.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our language this is called positive feedback. &amp;quot;Planned Ignoring&amp;quot; is negative feedback. It discourages a specific behaviour and avoids escalating things further, out of a region where both the carer and the child can be cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one reason or another, these things are hard-wired inside us. And sometimes we cannot escape them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of this stuff, you come across because of work. Some others, because of mistakes. While we learn from mistakes, sometimes it is impossible to correct mistakes (in an &amp;quot;undo&amp;quot; kind of way. There is always time for self improvement of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this board involves human interaction. But I am not sure how much we are &amp;quot;trained&amp;quot; to recognise positive from negative stress. All learning involves stress. But there might be other things, around the learning that push someone to a region where they will completely shutdown or revert to a learned behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But looking around, I could not find a &amp;quot;course&amp;quot; or a resource about learning some of this stuff for adults in a practical and concise way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of such courses or resources?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnpsychology.org/student-stress-anxiety-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; guide for example that is very usefull, but I am not sure if it is comprehensive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recent events have prompted me to revisit this post regarding &amp;quot;stress&amp;quot;. Maybe it is worth expanding it to other external factors that may be driving the behaviour of a person to such an extent that it can allow certain behaviours to permeate throughout the board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was amazed by the sheer effort and genuine attempts of at least 4 contributors on this board over the span of many hours to genuinely understand what the point of a question was but instead, line by line, argument by counter-argument descending into an unproductive, convoluted interaction that stops being about about a technical issue and &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; the main issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that it is worth having a think on recognising these interactions and steping back in time, before they blow up and become counter-productive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recognising it and handling it in a dissociated and calm way. And to extreme cases, this might also be the right thing to do to &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; the other person whose state, as evidenced from just what they are writing and how they express themselves is already clearly upset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1212" LastEditorUserId="1212" LastEditDate="2020-07-15T16:47:54.310" LastActivityDate="2020-07-15T16:47:54.310" Title="How good are &quot;we&quot; at recognising and responding to stress?"

I'd have asked on the main site if that were (only) the case. I'm interested in how relavent DIP, NIP and CV are here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This community seems to be the only place where I can ask Image Processing related queries. I hope this is the right place to contribute that content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've made a trello board of topics I'd like to study: &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/3bLroaxd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://trello.com/b/3bLroaxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Images and Signals are equivalent? I'm not sure. I know vectors can be involved in both. So, maybe the same analysis tools could be used in both domains. A quick search validates my intuition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image processing&lt;/strong&gt; is a method to convert an image into digital form and perform some operations on it, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of &lt;strong&gt;signal dispensation&lt;/strong&gt; in which input is image, like video frame or photograph and output may be image or characteristics associated with that image. Usually Image Processing system includes treating images as two dimensional signals while applying already set &lt;strong&gt;signal processing&lt;/strong&gt; methods to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to @Deve from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1321/should-there-be-a-separate-image-processing-computer-vision-se-site&quot;&gt;this relavent thread&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It's no problem if there are &quot;shadow communities&quot; inside DSP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I don't believe there's any merit in  proposing a DIP stackexchenge at Area51.

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to signal processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

I was truly expecting something more substantive, something I hadn't thought of, something that arose out of considered debate by knowledgeble parties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discussion in the comments can be classified in five broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Clarification of the issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Contention about the issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Tangential Topics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Unrelated Topics (Tangents on tangents)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) &quot;Meta&quot; talk&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first two, some of the third, and the last, the value of the discussion is greatly reduced when it is removed from its referential frame.  Only the fourth doesn't suffer from that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But they all suffer from a significant drop in likelihood of being read by shunting them off to a &quot;chat room&quot;.  Yeah, I don't do &quot;chat rooms&quot;, nor will I follow conversations to a chat room.  I am sure many others feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it is discouraging when you have put a lot of thought into something, taken the effort to express it into just the right words for your intended recipient, to have it whisked away to somewhere it will rarely be seen, out of context if it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Likewise, it is discouraging when a newbie deletes a question and your carefully crafted answer along with it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, and it is broader than just for StackExchange, you will find the most valuable, and sometimes most entertaining, information in the commentary.  On news sites, I sometimes just skim over the articles and just read the commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does StackExchange consider the commmentary valuable?  I think the fact that MathJax doesn't work in the chat room is a pretty good indicator that it doesn't.  It's a matter of preference so I can't say you are wrong, but I can certainly say I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussion will often contain the key detail that an interested reader is missing for comprehension that does not get covered in the question or any of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rationale implicit in your answer is &quot;It makes pages too long and hard to follow.&quot;  I don't find that a problem as I am used to scanning through documents, but I recognize that is not true for all.

And, if you can't, why should the deacons of a discipline (I'm talking about the regulars here) propagate a bad practice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is more of a deepster question than it appears.  Please don't give a fired from the hip response.  Think about it a bit first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've elaborated a little bit on this in a question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/69186/dft-exercise-in-the-book-understanding-digital-signal-processing-3-ed/69233#69233&quot;&gt;DFT exercise in the book Understanding digital signal processing 3 Ed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, actually taking the point a little bit further.  I think it is damaging to teach the DFT strictly in the context of Seconds and Hertz as units.  One should not expect a first time learner to be able to differentiate the tool from its application.  There have been too many &amp;quot;Where do I plug in the Hertz when looking for repeat patterns in ....&amp;quot; (Paraphrasing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help that most the used MATLAB calls seem to Hertz and Seconds oriented either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you are an educator of this material, in any setting, please keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Response to Fat32's comment in RB-J's answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually I am coming at this form an epistemological direction.  I am well aware of the goal of DA (Dimensional Analysis) to achieve conceptual harmony to the natural physical constants (and approaching this goal is contrary to integrity checking of equations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My objection is to RB-J's role as an acolyte insisting that DA is &amp;quot;the only and true way&amp;quot; (and his combative manner).  Particularly since it was formalized by a &amp;quot;standards committee&amp;quot; (those with experience, insert running jokes here).  Whether rotation should be a dimension was and probably still is a big issue to wank over.  DA's definitions of &amp;quot;Dimension&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Unit&amp;quot; are the pedantic ones and I would think minority ones.  The carrying-the-units/math/common man definitions are much more down-to-earth (more concrete than abstract).  A dimension is a coordinate in a vector space, and a unit defines a measure along that coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to use DA to find &amp;quot;meaning in Physics&amp;quot;, fine.  But if you are looking for integrity checking to prevent calculation errors in formulas, you aren't using the best tool.  The lander crashed because &amp;quot;velocity&amp;quot; wasn't defined in units.  And I challenge you to assert the following equation is nonsense with the carry the units definition of a unit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$$ 2 \frac{\text{Semicircles}}{\text{Circle}} \cdot 1 \frac{\text{Circle}}{\text{Cycle}}  \cdot \pi \frac{\text{Radians}}{\text{Semicircle}} = 2 \pi \frac{\text{Radians}}{\text{Cycle}} $$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two kilos of apples is different than two kilos of oranges, so if you are weighing them, I kilo of apples weighs a kilo (conversion factor), and I kilo of oranges weighs a kilo (conversion factor), so you can add them (common units).   Note, no need to mention dimension.  If you are counting them, well you have so many apples (units) and so many oranges (units).  If you want to compare items of different units, you have to convert them to the same scale (units) using what is known as a &amp;quot;Value Function&amp;quot;.  The value function can be as simple as multiplying by a conversion factor (even if that factor is numerically 1).  &amp;quot;Pricing&amp;quot; is the most common value function there is.  Yes, carrying the units was developed mainly for use in &amp;quot;rate problems&amp;quot; to keep your units straight and it works well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between carrying the units vs DA is like weak typing vs strong typing in programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, deepster/fancy question du jour:  If the Universe didn't exist, would the values of &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\pi$&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$e$&lt;/span&gt; still exist?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope everybody agrees that this is a definitional issue, so I'd like to attempt to take the &amp;quot;my definition is right&amp;quot; aspect out of this, and shift to the implications of accepting either definition as the correct one.  To do so, I'm going to introduce two working definitions with the intention that the scope not exceed the extent of the this question and its answers, and that the nomenclature not favor one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;t-units = Traditional units, using the root meaning of &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, capable of any level of specificity by the act of naming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;s-units = Standardized units, as defined by the various ISO standards or other governing bodies&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no disagreement about the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;s-units are a subset of t-units&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In t-units, the answer to the title question is cycles per sample&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In s-units, the answer to the title question is unitless&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converting from t-units to s-units can be, and often is, lossy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three questions arise from these observations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.  Should t-units be stamped out?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.  Was it the intent of standardization to weaken the integrity validation capability of Dimensional/Unit Analysis?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C.  How does this relate to &amp;quot;political correctness&amp;quot; in general?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this is a pedantic (in a non-perjorative way) exercise, done in pedantic style.  That's the point of it being placed in Meta and tagged with &amp;quot;discussion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, everybody can see the setup, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check-mate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observation 4 validates Question B.  Question B is a yes/no question.  So what can be answered?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it is an unintended consequence.  Okay, you admit that it is detrimental to integrity checking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is intentional as it keeps things simple [A strong aversion to complexity has repeatedly been expressed here] and any loss of functionality is a small price to pay for the greater good of the benefits of standardization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either case, it is clear that a loss of validity has occurred.  Therefore the answer to Question A has to be a firm no.  Furthermore, those who attempt to do so are firmly in the wrong and should desist immediately, starting with RB-J.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question C takes us to a whole 'nuther level.  This is totalitarianism in one of its many forms.  I will fight it where ever I see it.  This is called the &amp;quot;good fight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is natural that engineers be attracted to technocracy, but you have to resist its siren song or you will surely crash on the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe in the dignity of critters, including biped furless chimps.

Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ A

indicate the frequency of moderation actions.

previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ A &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. &lt;a

indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

The scope of the question is perhaps too big for a single question - I didn't realize that in the beginning, but since &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/a/82043/25659&quot;&gt;@TimWescott quickly posted a partial answer&lt;/a&gt; while at the same time &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/82041/why-cant-quantum-phase-noise-in-radio-astronomy-amplifiers-just-be-filtered-out?noredirect=1#comment172196_82041&quot;&gt;suggesting the question was circular&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps unclear, I'm not sure if I should refine and narrow the question to match their current simple answer based on a trigonometric identity and separate out the rest for a new question or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below @TW's answer is a comment with the correct formula and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/82041/why-cant-quantum-phase-noise-in-radio-astronomy-amplifiers-just-be-filtered-out/82043#comment172263_82043&quot;&gt;@TW has commented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not touching the &amp;quot;quantum phase noise&amp;quot; because this is a DSP group, and &amp;quot;quantum&amp;quot; is about physics. So if the &amp;quot;quantum&amp;quot; part is retained, through demodulation, somehow (i.e., if quantum states stay entangled, and how you demodulate it either retains the entanglement or destroys it), then that's physics, not signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which makes what I should do next even more complicated because I'm not sure if the comment asserts that quantum phase noise can not be address with signal processing or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; The basis of my questions and the sources I site refer to the signals in radio telescope arrays, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Atacama Large Millimeter Array&lt;/a&gt; for example. To the extent of my understanding, there is no deliberate entanglement involved in the way these receivers work. Sources just mention &amp;quot;quantum noise&amp;quot; and that may be simply &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$K_B T$&lt;/span&gt; related but have nothing at all to do with entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty confident discussing of physics or at least physical processes that generate noise isn't purely &lt;em&gt;persona non grata&lt;/em&gt; here in DSP SE, but I'm not sure, and @TW doesn't cite any site policy or link to some consensus in meta that questions asking about addressing quantum phase noise via signal processing is off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if it's known that quantum phase noise can't be addressed via signal processing, then that seems to be an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; answer to my question about filtering quantum phase noise, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Phase noise in general (quantum or not) in signals is a new concept for me; it's likely I'm going to keep plugging along on my own slowly to better understand it. It turns out I will need to address phase noise in the 2D interference lattice (sometimes called moire patterns) produced by two real world near-periodic lattices (due to local forces and defects) in the future. So have patience as I seem to bounce back and forth between understanding and not understanding aspects of noise!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3705547/284619&quot;&gt;determining if a coincident point in a pair of rotated hexagonal lattices is closest to the origin?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/q/6993/201&quot;&gt;Proposing a 2D quasicrystal; what are the necessary and sufficient conditions?

We know our community can support a site, but it takes time to create this habit. Unfortunately, this proposal has a deadline and we need ALL the help we can get, as often as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need a SE site in Bioacoustics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because it is one of the fastest growing fields in both marine and terrestrial science. It gives us a unique opportunity to observe animal behavior and track populations’ distribution non-invasively.  Additionally, if done correctly, it can be easier and cheaper to collect data than traditional survey techniques. Most bioacoustic equipment is several thousand dollars/euros, sure, but that equipment can be left unattended, collecting data, ranging from weeks to months. This makes it more accessible to a larger group of researchers, and smaller companies are cropping up to make the startup costs even cheaper. However, analyzing that data can be a headache. You can find yourself with terabytes of acoustic data, and not know what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I’m not an expert, so this doesn’t sound like it’s for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need folks from ALL walks of life! We need experts, yes, but we also need enthusiastics, students, related professionals, and folks that are just curious.  We need folks asking questions that those of us conducting research wouldn’t think to ask in addition to the folks that can answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So please, check it out, and join us!

The STFT is a function of two independent variables, frequency in the DFT and the time of the center of the sliding window.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;repeatedly applies ... operates on&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; should stand in its own sentence and  start like &amp;quot;Its standard implementation&amp;quot;, and end with &amp;quot;but it can also be done with strided convolutions&amp;quot;.

The code is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;filter1 = fir1(16,400/16000,'low') %%pass band-400Hz, Sampling&#xA;frequency-16000Hz filter2 = fir1(16,800/16000,'high') %%pass&#xA;band-600Hz, Sampling frequency-16000Hz&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sum of coefficients of low pass filter adds to 1 whereas the sum&#xA;of filter coefficients of high pass filter does not add to 1.&#xA;Shouldn't the sum of filter coefficients add to 1?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and it came up with this response:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not necessarily the case that the sum of the coefficients of an&#xA;FIR filter should add up to 1. In fact, for many types of FIR filters,&#xA;the sum of the coefficients will not be equal to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the low pass filter you have created using the fir1&#xA;function, the sum of the coefficients does happen to be equal to 1.&#xA;This is because the fir1 function by default uses a windowing&#xA;technique to design the filter, which can cause the sum of the&#xA;coefficients to be equal to 1. However, this is not always the case,&#xA;and it is possible to design FIR filters using fir1 with other&#xA;windowing techniques that do not result in a sum of 1 for the&#xA;coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the high pass filter you have created, it is not necessarily the&#xA;case that the sum of the coefficients should be equal to 1. High pass&#xA;filters have a different frequency response than low pass filters, and&#xA;as a result, the coefficients of a high pass filter will typically be&#xA;different from those of a low pass filter. It is possible that the sum&#xA;of the coefficients of your high pass filter does not equal 1, but&#xA;this is not necessarily a problem with your filter design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421831/12570&quot;&gt;ChatGPT answers on SO have been banned&lt;/a&gt;, but I wondered what people think of this specific example?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;My take:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is correct as far as it goes, but it doesn't seem to exhibit any understanding of the deeper details of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it's correct.

indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes).

In fairness to the user and respecting their efforts to post legitimate questions, I was looking for a link I could include in my comment that provides clarity on what to post and not to post, to minimize the frustration of having a question &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot;, or the possible annoyance that I appear to be making up rules and not be helpful. I couldn't find a clear &amp;quot;Off Topic&amp;quot; list that would be easy for any new user to find. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; easily under Help - What types of questions should I avoid asking&amp;quot;. For consistency, with what we see when choosing to &amp;quot;vote to close&amp;quot;, should we have these same topics listed there verbatim (or even with further clarification if needed)?  Ideally not hidden under another link if they are elsewhere, but directly on that page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note too, as a minor grammatical nit: the first sentence of the page of &amp;quot;What types of questions should I avoid asking&amp;quot; suggests instead what to ask - I suggest it be written instead as: &amp;quot;Avoid posting questions that are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;on topic for this site&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyYJx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyYJx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Why not suited&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21048" LastActivityDate="2023-02-18T11:58:37.867" Title="Clear Guidance on Making Posts on DSP.Stackexchange" Tags="|feature-request|" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The real insult is being forced to pay for this garbage, with years of work. And I don't even get to complain?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not my fault teachers don't care about teaching, or were brainwashed into complacency with superficial knowledge. If you're homeless, it doesn't matter, you're only paid for &lt;strong&gt;competence&lt;/strong&gt; - and there's zero competence in the answers I received.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why does it happen?

At least that's the kindest interpretation - here's case by case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case 1&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/q/71661/50076&quot;&gt;Do symmetric signals have zero phase?&lt;/a&gt;, I write,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even-sampled zero phase&lt;/strong&gt;: attained by symmetry about &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$N / 2$&lt;/span&gt;, ignoring sample &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$n=0$&lt;/span&gt;. This amounts to &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;don't care&amp;quot; points, one at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$n=N/2$&lt;/span&gt; and other at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$n=0$&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odd-sampled zero phase&lt;/strong&gt;: same, but only one don't-care. Visually this is a flatline as opposed to a spike in even case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lU3Ra.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;/a&gt;. Hilmar writes,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$$&#xA;\begin{align}&#xA;\text{even: }&amp;amp;&amp;amp; x[-n] &amp;amp;= x[n] \\ &#xA;\text{odd: }&amp;amp;&amp;amp;x[-n] &amp;amp;= -x[n]&#xA;\end{align}&#xA;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With minimal thought, one sees, we're saying the exact same thing. Yet Hilmar sits at +7, while I at -4, and I didn't get a single upvote. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because Hilmar's &amp;quot;your boy&amp;quot; or whatever, and opens his answer as if contradicting the point in the question, or contradicting my answer. Meanwhile, my Q&amp;amp;A is meant to address the obviously misleading choice of terminology &amp;quot;symmetric&amp;quot;, as noone outside of or new to SP would consider this &amp;quot;symmetric&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2PhG.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's Marcus saying scipy, MATLAB and Wiki are &amp;quot;just tools&amp;quot; for acknowledging the concept of DFT-symmetry, and one of those comments is upvoted and there's zero disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case 2&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/a/70395/50076&quot;&gt;DFT coefficients meaning?&lt;/a&gt;, I originally wrote that DFT gives phases and amplitudes of sines that sum to the original signal. Firstly, that's equivalently true in the real case, but I admit it's flawed, and was quick to fix it. Despite that, nobody who downvoted bothered to retract it, there's still -3. Unless they think that the central claim, that it's amps &amp;amp; phases of &lt;em&gt;complex sinusoids&lt;/em&gt;, is wrong, I have the right to my intuitive interpretation in the rest of the answer, and I don't see such downvotes toward other posts of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case 3&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's harder to argue &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/q/86613/50076&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; definitively, but I'll include it. MBaz at +5,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That one &amp;quot;can approach theory as closely as one wants on a computer&amp;quot; (at least in many practical cases) is not new. The real engineering question is, what is the cost?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First sentence literally agrees with the thesis of my question (-3), second makes a point I make in the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then Dan in comments also agrees it's doable - &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ynfhh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;exact exchange&lt;/a&gt; - then in answer still writes 'not realizable', and &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Here is a simple example to demonstrate why there is no physically realizable &amp;quot;brickwall&amp;quot; filter.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, followed with plots, where the argument being made is on &lt;em&gt;accuracy&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;practicality&lt;/em&gt;. And of course no downvote or comment from MBaz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case *&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't recall the history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/q/70478/50076&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd love to hear how it deserves &lt;code&gt;-4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+0&lt;/code&gt; in its last form. Not counting this as official &amp;quot;case&amp;quot; because it's not as blatant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;Rudeness&amp;quot; bad, not for all&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case 4&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/q/70478/50076&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, Dilip Sarwate's response to my (genuine, non-inflammatory) Latex edits is &amp;quot;More nonsense&amp;quot;, sitting at &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt;.

Point is, it wasn't just one user (+3), it'd not be said toward a respected member, and it'd sure as hell not be +3 if coming from me to Dilip's question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Reading comprehension deficit (cont'd)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Case 5&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the deleted post, I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;acknowledge there's signals for which &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$|x(t)|^2$&lt;/span&gt; is meaningfully instantaneous energy, and contrast against cases for which it's power instead. Despite that, RBJ provides a different but conceptually identical example - &lt;code&gt;+4&lt;/code&gt;. Why?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;acknowledge &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$P = IV$&lt;/span&gt; argument from electronics, with units and everything. Despite that, Dan recites the &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPioo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;exact same information&lt;/a&gt;, followed by irrelevant tangents on &amp;quot;power vs energy signals&amp;quot; - &lt;code&gt;+2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why I called it garbage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear, I'm not particularly ticked at Dan and RBJ - I'm ticked  at the combined community response. Anyone has right to write lazy answers, or lazily interpret the question - but that's not all that's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's happening is history repeating, and again, people refusing to actually read what I wrote, or outright denying it as if religiously or politically - and approving of responses that completely ignore the ideas I carefully presented. It's &lt;strong&gt;disrespect&lt;/strong&gt;. And I have to put in extra work, re-explaining myself in bits and pieces - and even if I do, odds are good, the network just moves on and refuses to retract their disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If not for the ad-value of this network, I'd leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what can be done? Hell if I know. I'll change this ridiculous username soon enough, for one, don't worry. Besides that I figure I'll stop martyring for education and ignore content I find problematic.

You're not obligated to vote, comment, or read any post. So,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read fully before voting&lt;/strong&gt;. It's the most basic decency I grant everyone, with rare exceptions. There's many reasons I may open my post with what looks like you disagree with, only to clarify otherwise later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read fully before commenting&lt;/strong&gt;, or disclaim your commentary. How do you know I've not already said what you did? If others are as impatient, it suggests a contradiction with my post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read fully before answering&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a reasonable standard to be held to. Again there's reasons I may not include the whole question in bullet points - the bullets are there to assist, and I could easily force reading of the entire post instead. This includes questions &lt;strong&gt;and answers&lt;/strong&gt;; how do you know you don't repeat me (or others)? Or that you're even answering what's being asked?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;and answers&amp;quot; isn't critical, but if your answer implies a contradiction with another due to length/order of presentation, it should be disclaimed (e.g. &amp;quot;To add to OLGD's answer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;This answer is another perspective, not contradicting...&amp;quot;), if e.g. notified by answerer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Read fully&amp;quot; really only goes as far as &amp;quot;ensure your vote/comment/answer wasn't addressed&amp;quot;, for which a tactful skim most often suffices, but even that much &lt;strong&gt;is not being done&lt;/strong&gt;.

names&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁴ A &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user&quot;&gt;Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes). The community² can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁷ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁸ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

That said, I'm seeing here what I've seen on a lot of new sites: tag wikis and especially excerpts that give general-purpose definitions for the tag, without relating them to &lt;em&gt;the site&lt;/em&gt;! At best, this is... better than nothing. At worst, it's just noise. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/&quot;&gt;Here are some guidelines for writing tag wiki excerpts:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The excerpt is the elevator pitch for the tag.&lt;/strong&gt; You only have ~500 plain text characters for the excerpt, so don’t feel obligated to cover everything in it! Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized.&lt;/strong&gt; The “email” tag, for example, does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentrate on what a tag means to your community.&lt;/strong&gt; For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail, as that would be more appropriate for webapps.stackexchange.com.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, &lt;em&gt;what kinds of questions should have this tag?&lt;/em&gt; Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions, so if we don’t provide proper guidance on which questions &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; this tag, they won’t get tagged at all, rendering the tag excerpt moot. Think of it as a sales pitch: in a room full of tags screaming “pick me!”, what would convince a question asker to select your tag?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some tags are common knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; Most tags require a bit of explanation in the excerpt, even if it’s only 3 or 4 words. But if the tag is common knowledge — that is, if you &lt;em&gt;walked up to any random person on the street and said the tag word to them&lt;/em&gt;, and they would know what you were talking about — then don’t bother explaining the tag at all.

Until then, that option is not available for users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that providing an option in the close menu is a way to let the community decide where to chuck it without a mod intervention. This is a very bad idea when a site is new and budding, because of a few reasons as below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With all the initial activity and excitement, people are overenthusiastic in shipping things off to other sites. This might not actually be the right thing to do because we're still defining what's on topic for us and to what extent questions marginally outside our bounds will be tolerated. Also, we need questions!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a question is more math/programming related doesn't necessarily mean it's on-topic there or a good quality question. The community has to grow to learn and understand which questions should be moved and which shouldn't. The golden rule of migration is &quot;don't migrate crap&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can close questions with &lt;em&gt;just 1 rep&lt;/em&gt; in private beta. This means that a user, who has &lt;em&gt;no understanding&lt;/em&gt; of the SE system, can vote to migrate a question elsewhere, possibly flooding that site with questions that are possibly off-topic there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I've observed from other sites, a good number of the users who are active in the private beta and initial phase of public beta never make it to the end as dedicated users. We don't want good questions to be incorrectly shipped off by a small group of people w/o mod intervention, especially when the consensus of the larger community is yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sites never make it &lt;em&gt;out of beta&lt;/em&gt;, so providing a migration path to this site might result in certain questions dying when the site is shut down. So migration has to be done carefully and selectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the best thing to do right now is to flag it for a mod to migrate. In the initial days, the site is moderated by SE employees and they will not evaluate your flag unless a strong consensus builds up (i.e., a meta post with several in agreement or multiple flags). In a few weeks, they'll select pro-tem mods from the community who can gauge them better and they'll work with mods from the other sites in deciding if questions should be migrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="77" LastActivityDate="2011-08-18T19:17:05.170" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The one week of private beta is the &lt;em&gt;absolute minimum&lt;/em&gt; that a site needs to be in before opening up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also precedence of this happening. Cryptography.SE stayed longer in beta not necessarily because of poor quality questions or low activity, but because the nature of the site was highly specialized and they felt that it might help if they waited a little longer for more questions and answers. Freelancers.SE also remained in private beta because of extremely poor questions and zero activity and was eventually shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I probably wouldn't do it the way you've described.

Now I cannot possibly fathom of a DSP site where this answer would not receive copious upvotes. Does this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; answer the question? While it may be a great book, is it truly a good book for a &lt;em&gt;beginner&lt;/em&gt;? Who is a beginner?

Despite your claims that it was an &lt;em&gt;expert level&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;research question&lt;/em&gt;, your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/revisions/136/1&quot;&gt;actual phrasing of the question&lt;/a&gt; leaves a lot to be desired. The question did not make an effort to show that it is a research question &lt;strong&gt;that would be of interest to signal processing folks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the current question, the phenomenon is most likely due to physiochemical reasons and is not quite related to signal processing. While I agree with several of Pearsonartphoto's points, I disagree with the notion that just because some biological/physical/chemical reaction &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; also be written in signal processing terms, it makes it right to do so. That might be an interesting approach to perhaps get a point across, but should not substitute for an answer. For example, in a comment to his answer, I say that the transient effects could also be due to an increased relaxation time of the chemicals in the photoreceptors (plausible). Now the math behind my simple argument is merely an exponential decay, which also comes up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;radioactive decay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Arrhenius equation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;RC circuits&lt;/a&gt; among several others. Does that mean it is reasonable to explain how long it takes Uranium to decay to Thorium using RC circuits? I would think not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site should be for specific questions (within the scope) with specific answers. Definitely research level questions that make you think are welcome here.

  <row Id="95" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="93" CreationDate="2011-09-23T01:00:45.877" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;I think that for practitioners who are tasked with actually implementing DSP techniques in a product, attainable performance of hardware targeted toward signal processing are a very relevant topic. The real problem with benchmarks, however, is one of relevance toward your application. By their nature, performance benchmark data is ruled by the marketing departments of IC manufacturers; the whole purpose of publishing the data is to increase the number of units sold. Because of this, you usually see synthetic benchmarks like Dhrystone MIPS or unattainable theoretical throughput numbers like &quot;total number of MACs per second.&quot; These are of dubious value when it comes to actually evaluating a processor to see if it has the beef to handle your application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best way to see if a particular part is a good fit for your application is to dig in yourself and evaluate it in some depth. This might consist of analysis of the architecture's instruction set, peripherals, etc. to estimate the number of cycles that your algorithms and I/O will require. Even better, most manufacturers have embraced the fact that making low-cost development hardware available is a good way to promote your platform; nothing beats getting ahold of the real article to actually verify that your requirements can be met. DSP platforms of all kinds, from microcontrollers to large microprocessors to FPGAs, are becoming more and more amenable to rapid prototyping early in the design phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that is where I think the goal of making dsp.SE a place for publishing benchmarks becomes difficult. There is an almost incomprehensible number of combinations of hardware platforms, design constraints, and target algorithms; it's simply not practical to assume that you will be able to service everyone's performance estimation needs. Sure, there might be more common questions like &quot;what embedded architecture is best if I need to evaluate as many 4096-point FFTs per second as possible?&quot;, but I would expect those sorts of pointed questions to be rare (but I would still say they are on-topic). More commonly, I would expect a software radio designer, for example, who is trying to determine whether his OFDM receiver can be implemented in real-time on a specific processor. I can't imagine a general-purpose benchmark that would give him sufficient faith to make a hardware choice; instead, good-old-fashioned analysis of the details is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary: I have no problem with hardware-performance questions. They are a fact of life for those implementing DSP for a living. I don't think dsp.SE can practically be a storehouse of authoritative benchmark data. I also don't see this as a problem; sure, it points people away from the site, but so do many answers that reference Wikipedia or cite other sources. People who ask questions here shouldn't really care whether all of the answer is posted here; if they get a quality answer, then they will come back next time they have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="90" LastActivityDate="2011-09-23T01:00:45.877" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dislike the &amp;quot;most lucid explanation to teach your grandmother to use wavelets&amp;quot; kind of questions and I hope we don't see them very often. However, that's a different beast to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What should be our policy?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, algorithms, ideas and approaches should be first and foremost and &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; code in language X. I mean, the answerer can use whatever language they feel they're comfortable in (e.g., the river detection question had answers in MATLAB, python and Mathematica), but the focus of the question should not be an explicit &amp;quot;give be the codez in X&amp;quot;. Questions like show me how in any language and I'll work it out myself are also most welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicit requests for code in language X should be &lt;strong&gt;off-topic&lt;/strong&gt;. The primary reason for not allowing questions that simply want code in X is because then we'll get overrun by which ever language is most commonly used in the particular field, and other folks who are more inclined towards theory and algorithm development part of it might be put off and leave. I can easily see MATLAB/openCV questions just flooding us if we opened the gates (in fact, we get a few such questions which you don't see because they are either promptly migrated or nuked right here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Can we have the best of both worlds?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming to the question you linked to (electrophoresis gel), I in fact did comment on it and asked the OP if he was looking for code or approaches. He did seem pretty clueless, and looked like he wanted some code to solve his issue right away, so I left it at that. However, barring that, it fits very well with our site's scope and is a good example of the use of image processing in diverse fields.

I realize that our users might not have gotten the head start that Stack Overflow users would've gotten in terms of votes, and so I'm willing to put a bounty on every such question that I request for migration (only new questions), and does not have an already reasonable answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know if this will work or if it's a good idea, but I'm willing to give it a try. Since this was less than a day ago, I didn't have the time to bring it here as a meta post, but it's good that you did! I'd appreciate feedback on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A final word on migrations...&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please do not request for migration of old questions unless if it's really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; off-topic on Stack Overflow (or elsewhere) and &lt;em&gt;a very good question&lt;/em&gt; for our site.

However, the edits are not substantial as you claim, and there's practically no effort put into it. Here's a bit more to the story, just so people don't think that you've been grossly wronged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, you started flooding the queue with edits to tag wikis and excerpts, and you merely &lt;strong&gt;copied content from Wikipedia without any attribution whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;. You copied just enough to make it look believable that you wrote it, yet not too much to make anyone doubt it. Since you passed them off as your own, a few users who approved them were tricked into believing that they were original and were in fact impressed that someone took the time to write them all. Nearly 100 edits had passed before I saw your fresh batch of edits sitting in the queue the next morning and it so happened that I was familiar with a few of the wikipedia articles you copied from, and I immediately recognized that it was plagiarized. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plagiarism is not something we condone&lt;/strong&gt; and we're not in middle school anymore to not know that it's wrong. Moderators datageist and I had to spend nearly a full hour trying to fix your plagiarized content by searching for the sources and attributing them, and datageist spent a further few hours later that day fixing your earlier edits. This is not a good use of our time, and all of this was brought about because of your plagiarism. You should've really been suspended for it, but instead, I was a bit more forgiving and pulled you over in chat and told you to attribute sources and you agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your next batch of edits had sources dumped in the end, and we did approve them, with some fixes. What really flipped me off was &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/201&quot;&gt;this suggested edit&lt;/a&gt; which you've conveniently linked in your question. Specifically (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] from different times, or from different viewpoints.&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt; It is used in computer vision [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You couldn't even bother to remove the &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt; from Wikipedia's citation! That's how lazy and unsubstantial these edits are. It does not take any effort to copy two lines from Wikipedia and when even that is done sloppily, I see no other option other than to reject. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These aren't good tag wiki entries either. Tag wikis are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; proxies for Wikipedia. It probably takes me the same number of clicks to get to a tag wiki article as it does to a wikipedia article and I get less information! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tag wiki is supposed to educate users about the kind of questions you expect in the tag and perhaps what not to ask and if additional tags need to be used.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/tags/culinary-uses/info&quot;&gt;culinary uses&lt;/a&gt; tag on cooking.SE is a good example. It tells you what kind of questions use the tag, what kind of questions are not appropriate and has some tips on answering. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gardening.stackexchange.com/tags/apples/info&quot;&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gardening.stackexchange.com/tags/identification/info&quot;&gt;identification&lt;/a&gt; tags from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gardening.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;gardening.SE&lt;/a&gt; are other examples that come to mind. If a tag becomes extremely popular, the tag could have its own collection of FAQ and tutorials like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala/info&quot;&gt;scala&lt;/a&gt; tag on Stack Overflow. However, we have a long way to go before we get there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that the first iteration of the tag wiki needs to be perfect. However, I do think it needs to be more substantial than copy-pasta. The mistake was that we, the users who approved, fell into the trap of &lt;em&gt;something is better than nothing&lt;/em&gt;.

To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, algorithms, ideas and approaches should be first and foremost and not code in language X. I mean, the answerer can use whatever language they feel they're comfortable in (e.g., the river detection question had answers in MATLAB, python and Mathematica), but the focus of the question should not be an explicit &amp;quot;give be the codez in X&amp;quot;. Questions like show me how in any language and I'll work it out myself are also most welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicit requests for code in language X should be &lt;strong&gt;off-topic&lt;/strong&gt;. The primary reason for not allowing questions that simply want code in X is because then we'll get overrun by which ever language is most commonly used in the particular field, and other folks who are more inclined towards theory and algorithm development part of it might be put off and leave. I can easily see MATLAB/openCV questions just flooding us if we opened the gates (in fact, we get a few such questions which you don't see because they are either promptly migrated or nuked right here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, Jonas had a point that it should be OK for users to present their problem (with code if necessary) in whatever language they're using, as long as the approach is clear from their code (i.e., no brainfuck or golfscript like code). Further more, there will be no guarantees of an answer in that particular language, i.e., if someone knows a good algorithm and explains it via Mathematica/MATLAB/python for an OpenCV question, then it should be fine. It's up to the OP to translate it (they can always go to Stack Overflow for help with that). I think this is a very reasonable position and will help foster a language-agnostic culture, instead of the language-free culture we've been having up until now. Some examples of good, recent questions like this are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/864/surface-detection&quot;&gt;Surface detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/712/measuring-length-of-dna-fibers-from-an-image-of-single-molecules/713#713&quot;&gt;Measuring length of DNA fibers from an image of single molecules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/675/find-the-stomata-in-a-plant-microscopy-image/681#681&quot;&gt;Find the stomata in a plant microscopy image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the OP was looking for a solution in a particular language, but were both happy to learn of a possible approaches in different languages and I presume, are working on translating whatever helped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming to your examples, the first question should not have been asked here. It was originally  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8315944/how-to-provide-region-of-interest-roi-for-edge-detection-and-corner-detection&quot;&gt;asked on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, and Endolith, a good contributor to this site recommended dsp.se. However, I won't fault him for that, because the SO version looked more like a conceptual question, which would've been a good fit, whereas the OP decided to dump his code here. The answer barely passes the minimum characters required. I'll ship it back to SO sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second one though, is very much on-topic. Note the last line: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The result inverse contains complex values, that confuses me.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; That is the crux of the question. The rest is just to support the story. It is clear that the problem is a conceptual one and the OP merely provided his code to guide the question and perhaps confirm if his problem is with the code or with his understanding. These are actually the kind of questions that would be very interesting on this site.

They understand that too, which is why you see sites launch even with 3-4 questions/week. The important criteria here is traffic.

So far, Jonsca is the only person that has ever reviewed and voted to close and there are 13 posts currently in the queue (as I can see it... different people see different numbers). Another place to look for posts with recent close votes is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;amp;daterange=last30days&quot;&gt;tools page&lt;/a&gt; (you need at least 2k rep).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I do monitor these queues, but I generally don't vote to close unless it has 3-4 close votes already (or if it is extremely terrible). This is because my vote, as a moderator, is binding and I'd like to see some community effort/agreement in closing. In the early days of this site, I was more active in closing duplicates and slamming shut the localized/off-topic and non-constructive questions to guide the site (and new users) when it's young. Back then, we only had two 2k+ users (myself and Jason), whereas now we are over a year old and have 11 users with 2k+ rep (and access to tools), and about 50 or so with the privilege to close, so there is no need for me or the other mods to be as proactive as before.

The most discouraging thing about the September evaluation was that the number of evaluators dropped from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1223/lets-get-critical-jun-2013-site-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1237/lets-get-critical-sep-2013-site-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  The December eval was completed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1249/lets-get-critical-dec-2013-site-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; people.  With so few people looking at questions, it's not surprising that voting will be noisy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since April, there have been about 600 questions/quarter.  Of those, only 10 are represented in each evaluation.  (The sample does not include unanswered, downvoted, or closed questions.) So an especially good or bad sample won't tell the full story.  It's possible we got unlucky with the questions selected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Too few reviewers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We collect data on how many people are active on the site 5 times or more in a month as a rough estimate of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;user engagement&lt;/a&gt;.  In the last year, that number has hovered around 45.  These are the people who are most likely to participate in self-evaluations.  We also measure people who post on the site at least once.  These more casual visitors have more or less doubled (to about 400) in the last 12 months.  Naturally, the number of posts has also roughly doubled in that period.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that can happen on a site is that contributions from newer users can overwhelm site regulars.  When that happens basic cleanup tasks can suffer.

Obviously you should always respond as soon as you can... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, moderators have this responsibility to keep the level of this website as high as possible. I've spent a lot of time on various forums, and in the end, 90% of questions were home works without any user input whatsoever (maybe except of rewriting it). On DSP SE we have a chance to keep the level high by poking the OP's to include more details, describe what they did so far, guide them, or eventually close the question and delete it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

The question/reputation graph possibly rules out the number of questions as a fine variable:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6nsWb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6nsWb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Questions-reputation graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, going to 3D, we can try answer/month/reputation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/teKQC.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/teKQC.png&quot; alt=&quot;Answers-month-reputation graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or answer/reach/reputation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIhCc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIhCc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Answers-reach-reputation graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those 3D graphs seem to display a bended shape, which clusters when projected in 2D.

Not in the traditional &quot;journal&quot; sense, meanwhile predatory publishing or randomized peer-review, to name a few, have changed the deal. A post in SE.DSP can sometimes be much more peer-reviewed than a paper in some conferences/journals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, SE.DSP as a site has no DOI. It can vanish, questions and answers can be edited, deleted. There is no means, as far as I know, to freeze a citable version, as you could do for other web sources like wikipedia. Suppose that you cite a page for a &quot;true result&quot;, to sustain a part of you paper. If it changes, turns wrong, or disappears, your results may remain correct, but without a source. In that sense, SE is not &lt;strong&gt;auditable&lt;/strong&gt; at the time of writing. As said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tim.thorpeallen.net/Courses/Reference/Citations.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Citing References in Scientific Research Papers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is important to properly and appropriately cite references in&#xA;  scientific research papers in order to acknowledge your sources and&#xA;  give credit where credit is due.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And about the sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sources that need to be acknowledged are not limited to books and&#xA;  journal articles, but include internet sites, computer software,&#xA;  written and e-mail correspondence, even verbal conversations with&#xA;  other people (in person or by telephone). All different kinds of&#xA;  sources must be acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I doubt a Q&amp;amp;A link can  be used directly, as of today, for a &quot;scientific publication&quot;. But... a publication is about making something public. It does not anymore restrict the sole paper pdf. So I propose these options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you want to pay credit to SE.DSP, vote answers up, share the OP, put a link to the related answer on a blog, webpage, etc. together with a link to your paper; you can even refer to the main SE.DSP site as a source of inspiration;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you want to pay credit to someone, ask him for the reference, thank him in the paper, add a &quot;personal communication&quot; to the reference list. But you likely are to rephrase the mentioned result in your paper, so that it can be checked. You can even collaborate with someone;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you want to pay back: add your answer, contribute the community wiki. Perhaps one day our community wiki will be truly citable;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[EDIT] As proposed by Marcus Müller (credits well deserved), one could resort to forms of digital archive.

And it can be difficult to suppress that reaction you get when you are trying to understand what may be motivating such a &quot;provoking&quot; question. Some of them are obvious: &quot;Do the research for me&quot;, &quot;Write some code, I cannot be bothered&quot;, &quot;Hey, what does this mean, because you know, I do have a connection to the internet but why use a search engine?....Thanks in advance...&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the sieving &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; difficult because of language barriers, because of education gaps, even because of slight misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we cannot but ask for clarification when in doubt.

But, what if they don't know where to start? I think that in that case, you need to start backtracking &quot;To understand this, you need to have understood that and for that you also need to have grasped this one over here...&quot; and so on. So, if they cannot show progress, can they at least provide basic definitions? The hints that are provided in the comments are a very good response to this, it's a relatively new thing, I do not remember hints a few years back. I think that those who care, will follow a knowledgeable dot trying to nudge them towards the right direction. Those that are in for the &quot;quick reward&quot; will simply give up. The problem there is, what do you do with that question which is not closed gracefully?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The only trouble I see with &lt;em&gt;&quot;...links to good examples...&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is the copy-paste approach which optimises for wording...but not meaning :/&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little information questioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This can be a disaster, from the point of view of the answer-er because it can get you off topic.

Welcome here. I'd like to help you improve your first question for maximum effect. Let's take this apart: &quot;The best&quot; according to which metric? You can't say &quot;the best car&quot; without saying with respect to what (top speed,max load,fuel consumption,number of cup holders…). Then: Audio watermarking really is a broad topic and you can find very many, even beginner-friendly, resources using google, so we need to expect you to do a bit of your own research. My wild guess is that you've done quite some research (you did end up here, somehow,didn't you?). So, tell us what you've found out so far!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's admittedly one of my explicitly more nice first comments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does this kind of thing work, where I do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify shortcoming of new question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Close-Vote as appropriate per previous point&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Leave Comment, encouraging improvement, often even in very simple terms (real-world analogies etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often yes, but in the general case: not quite sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as said, people who are actively actually looking for solutions to a problem that they've really tried to investigate as well as they could are typically very positive about feedback and questions for clarification. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case above, the last two questions of OP were practically my indicator for &quot;there likely won't be anything coming out of this&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do have a lot of people that really try to avoid reading that book chapter and hope that we, upon being triggered by the right buzzwords, just magically funnel knowledge without effort of their own right into their cortex. I doubt that this typically is as consciously explicit as I just stated it! I instead assume that a lot of people simply are rather stressed when they come here, simply because signal processing is among the more math-y things they'll do and the work load of getting to grips with a chapter is very much having understood all the basic definitions leading up to that chapter; which more often than not means &quot;basically all previous chapters&quot; in their textbook. Since they don't (feel like they) have the time, they hope for shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's questionable we need to embrace these shortcut-seekers as is – simply because that leaves no positive impact on us, on the site (simplifying answers is what they seek, not correct ones), and questionable impact on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we need to embrace is their potential to convert a &quot;do my understanding for me&quot; into a specific &quot;I have a lack of understanding for this, how can I change that?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what needs to happen is that we more clearly say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hi! Welcome here. The way you ask this might mean you're having a hard time understanding your question's basics and hope we can give you a more concise answer than your literature research could do for you. We're afraid that's not the case. &lt;strong&gt;However,&lt;/strong&gt; if you can rephrase your question to be like: &quot;I need to solve {PROBLEM}, and for that I need to understand {ASPECT}&quot; with the first ASPECT you encounter (don't be shy!) that you don't understand, you'll be getting forward in no time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and really mean it. I don't object to answering easy, small questions, and if it is by citing definitions, if these are sufficiently researched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that rewarding doing the decomposition of their problem into smaller questions that can individually be answered, maybe even by themselves, will lead to more questions asked after sufficient thought has been given, and the answers to these will encourage these askers to ask more, increasingly complex-but-well-researched (as opposed as complex and unresearched) questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That comes at two expenses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we need to encourage breaking down questions until each question asked occurs to even the asker as fundamental, then there's no &quot;too easy&quot; questions anymore.&lt;br&gt; I'm guilty of thinking those exist myself (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/50002/why-does-it-mean-that-the-process-signal-is-not-stationary-when-its-variance-var#comment97763_50002&quot;&gt;example comment&lt;/a&gt;).

Here's a copy of the question and its answer.  I'll delete this answer if I believe I can validly undelete the original.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared to standard (conventional) beamformers, adaptive beamformers such as minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) have much better resolution and interference nulling capabilities. Briefly, the MVDR beamformer is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\mathbf{a}_\theta$&lt;/span&gt; is the look-vector in the direction &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\theta$&lt;/span&gt; and if &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\widehat{\mathbf{R}}$&lt;/span&gt; is the covariance matrix of observations, then the adaptive weight vectors are calculated as &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$$\mathbf{w}_\theta=\frac{\widehat{\mathbf{R}}^{-1} \mathbf{a}_\theta}{\mathbf{a}^H_\theta \widehat{\mathbf{R}}^{-1} \mathbf{a}_\theta}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and the output power of the MVDR beamformer is &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$$B_{mvdr}(\theta)=\mathbf{w}_\theta^H \widehat{\mathbf{R}}\mathbf{w}_\theta$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of completeness, the conventional beamformer output power is &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$B_{conv}(\theta)=\mathbf{a}_\theta^H \widehat{\mathbf{R}}\mathbf{a}_\theta$&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, these adaptive beamformers are also prone to severe performance hits when there is a signal mismatch i.e., when the steering vector model for the signal of interest doesn't match what's in the data or when the actual array positions are perturbed from the array positions used in the steering/look vectors (which is what happens in practice). The performance degradation can be so large that it becomes inferior to the conventional beamformer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can one increase the robustness of adaptive beamformers (in this case, the MVDR, but applicable more generally) to signal mismatches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Example:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the result from a simulation with two plane wave signals, one at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$+30^\circ$&lt;/span&gt; and the other at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$-22.5^\circ$&lt;/span&gt; and 10 dB down from the first, impinging on a 10 element uniform line array (spaced at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\lambda/2$&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\lambda$&lt;/span&gt; is the wavelength) in a noisy environment (the exact value of the noise power is immaterial here and you can assume it to be much lower than the signal powers). The covariance matrix is formed from 50 observations (snapshots). The top two panels show the outputs of the MVDR and the conventional beamformers and you can clearly see that the MVDR has high resolution compared to the conventional. Both do a good job of estimating the signal power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when the element positions are slightly perturbed (perturbation is unknown to the beamformer), causing a mismatch in the actual signal steering vector and the model, the signal power estimates of the MVDR beamformer goes kaput. It can hardly measure them correctly, although it still does a good job of localising the signals. Comparatively, the conventional beamformer gets the relative powers right, although its harder to localise the signal due to increased sidelobes. (Note: The plots have all been normalized by the maximum power so although you can't see it, the peak at &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$30^\circ$&lt;/span&gt; in the top left plot is at 0 dB. So this doesn't truly show how the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; power estimate degrades due to mismatches, as I just wanted to paint a qualitative picture.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VvzkF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plots with MVDR Perturbed Array sloppily corrected in Gimp&quot;&gt;&#xA;http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/146/how-can-one-improve-the-robustness-of-adaptive-beamformers-to-signal-mismatches#comment-308 :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The title for the lower left plot should read MVDR: Perturbed array. &#xA;  I'll correct the mistake sometime soon. &#xA;  – yoda Sep 3 at 5:28&#xA;  --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for me to improve the estimates of the signal powers using the MVDR beamformer in the perturbed case?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One approach that I'm aware of is to &quot;load&quot; the diagonal of &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\widehat{\mathbf{R}}$&lt;/span&gt; by some value &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\sigma_d^2$&lt;/span&gt; in order to stabilize the covariance matrix and make the adaptive vectors more robust to signal mismatches.

And as they say, &amp;quot;I wasn't born yesterday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Properly, &amp;quot;units&amp;quot; should remain as general as possible.  If you want to give a special meaning linguistically, it requires its own modifier.  Like &amp;quot;SI Units&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;standard units&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;basis units&amp;quot;, etc.  Nobody, or no body, gets to say &amp;quot;these are the officially approved 'units' and everything else you used to consider a unit is now a 'factor label'&amp;quot;  Once that kind of control is ceded, it is never recovered and the control freaks get to have a field day.  And they won't stop there.  Whether OCD is a mental disease or a personality type doesn't matter, it is no excuse, and it isn't a hall pass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any quantity you measure, is measured on a scale and some reference is the unit with a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; value and there is a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; value.  Normalizing is simply a rescaling by picking a representative value and declaring it to be the new &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; on the new scale.  Thus, you are still measuring along the same dimension, all that has happened is a rescaling conversion factor has been defined and applied.  It does not all the sudden lose its dimensionality.  Even if you define a new origin, a new &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;, you still just have a rescaling, but now with a bias.  It is still along the same dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The notion that only officially approved &amp;quot;Dimensions&amp;quot; are allowable, is Orwellian to say the least.  Dimension is a scale type answering the quality (as in property or attribute) of that which is being measured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A normalized frequency is still measuring frequency, just on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A normalized height is still measuring height, just on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither are unitless (a null concept, every scale has a unit) nor dimensionless (another null concept, every scale has a type).  Counting numbers are the tic marks on a scale, they are still in the same units in the same dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Height is a different dimension than length.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It isn't this way because &amp;quot;Ced said so.&amp;quot;, it is this way because this is the way it is.  If you think I got it wrong, then you need to argue on the merits, not appeal to authorities like governing bodies or textbook authors, or appeal to the crowd by saying this is the way everybody does it in our club.  You don't get to shoot the messenger either because you disagree with the message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words have meaning.

In the context of signal frequency, such as the Nyquist frequency, it refers to one &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt; of a continuous periodic signal.  And in the context of sampling, such as the Nyquist rate, Fat32 equates it to &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/span&gt;, the sampling interval.  If we were to rename those units respectively as &lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;samples&lt;/em&gt;, the units of normalized signal frequency, &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$f/f_s$&lt;/span&gt;, are &lt;em&gt;periods/sec / samples/sec = periods/sample&lt;/em&gt;, which is not unitless (they don't cancel).  Therefore, the only disagreement here comes down to the common practice of substituting &lt;em&gt;cycles&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt;, and the uncommon (IMO) practice of substituting &lt;em&gt;cycles&lt;/em&gt; for sample-intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might also be useful to recall how Oppenheim &amp;amp; Schafer, 2nd ed, 1999, pp 140-141 introduce sampling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/span&gt; is the sampling period, and its reciprocal, &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$f_s=1/T$&lt;/span&gt;, is the sampling&#xA;frequency, in &lt;strong&gt;samples per second&lt;/strong&gt;. [Note they never say Hz in relation&#xA;to sampling, although (as Fat32 said) other authors do.].  We also&#xA;express the sampling frequency as &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\Omega_s = 2\pi/T$&lt;/span&gt; when we want to use&#xA;frequencies in radians per second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implied conversion factor from &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$f_s$&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\Omega_s$&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$2\pi$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;radians per sample&lt;/em&gt;, which only makes sense when &lt;em&gt;sample-interval&lt;/em&gt; is synonymous with &lt;em&gt;cycle&lt;/em&gt; (Fat32's semantic)... bringing us back to the semantic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: &lt;em&gt;Hz/Hz = cycles/sec / cycles/sec&lt;/em&gt; is not unitless when the numerator &amp;quot;cycles&amp;quot; has a different definition than the denominator &amp;quot;cycles&amp;quot;.

So strictly speaking, DSP is &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; about starting with a signal that has known mathematical properties -- or at least it has mathematical properties whose unknowns are bounded in a firmly known way.  Technically, DSP folk know nothing about the signal &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; (but often they do -- see below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's reasonable to expect at least some (but not all) DSP folks to have a pretty good idea of how a signal received by an ordinary terrestrial radio, or over an ordinary terrestrial phone line, or by an ordinary electronic camera might behave, because that covers a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of what DSP folks do in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example: I'm working a lot with imaging these days, and if you're working with low return levels then you run head-on into a &amp;quot;quantum noise&amp;quot; effect.  To wit, a photon striking a pixel has a certain probability of knocking an electron loose, and that electron has a certain probability of getting collected into the pixel's capacitor (the product of those two probabilities is the detector's &amp;quot;quantum efficiency&amp;quot;, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your &amp;quot;quantum noise&amp;quot; just means that you have a detector that, one way or another, counts photons -- great.  That's easy enough that I can understand it &lt;strong&gt;after you state that clearly in your question&lt;/strong&gt;.  I know that I'm dealing with a front-end that has a Poisson process followed by some random noise process (analog to digital converters &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have some random noise), and I can deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if your &amp;quot;quantum noise&amp;quot; has some &lt;strong&gt;quantum mechanical solution&lt;/strong&gt;* then &lt;strong&gt;I can't help you&lt;/strong&gt;, because that requires a knowledge of quantum mechanics -- and quantum mechanics is the purview of physicists, not DSP experts.  Also -- and forgive us if we didn't state it -- but your question boiled down to &amp;quot;read a bunch of impenetrable academic papers that are totally out of your specialty and give me a read on what they mean in this context&amp;quot;.  That's pretty much out of scope of any group at any time.  It's up to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to excerpt the juicy bits, and maybe interpret them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't tell you, as a DSP person, whether aiming the 1550nm laser ten microradians to the right is going to reduce the &amp;quot;quantum noise&amp;quot;, or whether adding another Josephine junction will do the same.  That's not DSP, that's quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you give me ten incoming signals and &lt;em&gt;you tell me how they correlate&lt;/em&gt; or even give me someone &lt;em&gt;else's&lt;/em&gt; equation on how they correlate, then I may be able to tell you how to extract useful information from them, because that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; DSP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, asking a DSP person to read a paper by an astrophysicist to work out the quantum mechanics of their device to determine if the resulting problem is quantum mechanics or just signal processing is &lt;em&gt;out of scope&lt;/em&gt; -- but saying what the signal looks like as a mathematical entity and then asking a question about it is &lt;strong&gt;in scope&lt;/strong&gt;.  Ditto, asking a DSP person to read a paper about cardiology to determine how to evaluate an EKG for a person's health is &lt;em&gt;out of scope&lt;/em&gt;, but telling us what the signal looks like as a mathematical entity, and how it looks different when someone is sick and then asking how to sort it out is &lt;strong&gt;in scope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need someone to read all those papers for you and say &amp;quot;oh, well, that just boils down to signal processing&amp;quot; that's the job of a physicist or whoever wrote the papers.  Once you can say &lt;em&gt;in your question&lt;/em&gt; that (A) it's just signal processing, and (B) the nature of the signal to be processed, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; it's a question for a signal processing group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;* e.g. if there's something you can do with gallons of liquid helium and lasers and exotic detectors that lets you squeeze the noise (e.g. the phase-noise quantum squeezing that they've put into LIGO, where they get better phase noise performance at the expense of higher amplitude noise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45593" LastActivityDate="2022-04-09T18:27:32.247" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Hopefully you will find something useful:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't tactically downvote&lt;/strong&gt; answers (&amp;quot;competing answers&amp;quot;) other than yours in order to improve the ranking of your answer. There are people behind the other answers and the downvoting is a message to those people and to others who see the downvotes, saying: &amp;quot;Do not write an answer to a question that this person has answered or is likely to answer.&amp;quot; I acknowledge that you don't always downvote competing answers. The other answers may complement your answer or may express the same thing in a better way, and others should not be discouraged from writing such answers. It can be that while you think that your answer is the most useful available answer to a general reader, it is actually not. The consensus of users expressed by votes is likely to be more accurate than the judgement of an individual contributor, you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not manipulate votes by deleting a downvoted post and reposting it.&lt;/strong&gt; Gaming the system is &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/331598&quot;&gt;unlikely to be perceived positively&lt;/a&gt;. If you write a new answer then there is no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When editing an answer, especially if you previously made an erroneous statement in the answer, do not as a rule write a new part into the answer but instead &lt;strong&gt;edit the whole answer&lt;/strong&gt; so that at no part you make an erroneous statement. It is fine to give commentary on what erroneous train of thought is possible. This way when someone is reading a part of the answer there is no danger that they disregard a co-dependent part of the answer that cancels the mistake. And it makes the answer shorter. A lengthy and convoluted post may not get read and absorbed thoroughly, with the result of other users likely concentrating more on apparent mistakes in the post. Admittedly it is more work to edit the whole answer, but consider also the time others would need to spend reading the answer. To be clear, there should be no honor code in place that prevents changing an erroneous statement made in one's post. If you still don't feel like editing your post rather than just appending to it, make it clear that you welcome others to do it for you. They might do it to help you in the least by giving you an example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When getting critique or downvotes with commentary, &lt;strong&gt;try to make use of the critique&lt;/strong&gt; and review your post instead of turning against the person who gave the critique or downvoted. Doing that would be easier to you if there was always also a comment with a downvote. But some people are afraid of commenting to your posts in fear of a negative response and grudge from you, directed at their person. If you would behave in a way that does not elicit such fears I think you would get more comments together with any downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not assume, state or imply that any individual community member or the whole community is stuck with a technical view&lt;/strong&gt; that prevents them from understanding a problem from a better technical view that you believe that you have. Someone who is well experienced in the subject matter may take such a statement as disrespect, and showing disrespect is likely not helping you gain their respect. I think the best point of view to take is that people have tools in their toolset (for example periodicity assumptions when working with the discrete Fourier transform) that they can use in order to solve a problem, and more tools is always better; for any given problem you'd use the tools that best work for you, and having the other tools back there in your arsenal is never a problem. Admittedly, sometimes people assign to mathematical entities properties that are not expressible or verifiable mathematically, to fluidify their intuition. Anyway, everyone can always learn something new, and you have already demonstrated being capable of bringing something new (and useful) to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using established subject matter terminology to describe something else than what the established meaning of the terminology is, &lt;strong&gt;make it clear what you mean by the terms that you use&lt;/strong&gt;. This is difficult to do if you are not familiar with the established terminology, but comments from others can help. You could also make it clear that others can edit your post to make the distinction clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't be rude&lt;/strong&gt; or verbally abusive. Issues can be raised without resorting to unacceptable behavior. While some may be immune, rudeness, verbal abuse, or other unacceptable behavior will lower respect towards you from many community members. It is not acceptable to make dismissing statements of perceived negative qualities of others. If you have a frustration, try to find a way to vent it that does not hurt anyone. Recognize that your conclusions are based on just your experiences with the person, which always gives a narrow, possibly incorrect picture. If you have had previous negative experiences, you may be projecting those onto your present interactions in a misguided way. Case in point, my suggestions here result from interactions with multiple users who have had friction with the community, and I cannot know which of my suggestions applies or are helpful to you. Other's behavioral responses may be triggered by a pattern that is common in their previous bad experiences and your current behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it helps to &lt;strong&gt;concentrate on the subject matter&lt;/strong&gt; rather than the persons. It may be useful to think of other people's undesired responses to your posts from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bayesian&lt;/a&gt; or utilitarian point of view. They may respond in a way that maximizes the utility of their response based on the evidence available to them. This way of thinking may help you to disassociate and keep your cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't take as insult if an answer spells out things known to you.&lt;/strong&gt; Stack Exchange is a knowledge base and an answer to a question by you may not be addressed at you personally but to any reader. Even if it was in some way addressed at you and you feel insulted by the assumption made that you don't know those things, overall for the site it is still better if things are spelled out. Readers who don't know those things will come by. You could also do the spelling out yourself in the question to explain your current understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect that &lt;strong&gt;users post and interact here on a fully voluntary basis&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, when and in whatever way they please. They may be motivated by entirely different things than those that interest you and that you post about. They might not engage with you, and that's alright. People may avoid chatting in comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19757/305709&quot;&gt;in order to do the right thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use comments primarily to comment on a post.&lt;/strong&gt; If the post is edited to address your concern, delete the comment. There should be no honor code or such against deleting comments, and comments should not be retained just to keep some sort of proof of merit. Comments that are no longer helpful become noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appreciate that if you &lt;strong&gt;write a more clear answer&lt;/strong&gt;, then the answer is more likely to get upvotes. Writing a more clear answer may involve clarifying terms that are likely to be foreign to the average audience. You have no obligation to improve your post, but if you want a good response, it will help if you do. People do try to understand your posts, and may have used a lot of their time trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe that the community cannot improve, then you by definition also believe that it is useless, for the purposes of improving the community, to vent about it. &lt;strong&gt;Try to have a bit of hope&lt;/strong&gt;, as this will improve the usefulness of your possible complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume good faith.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are also suggestions to the rest of the community, in order to make some contributors feel more respected:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace alternative notation and terminology.&lt;/strong&gt; It is not too critical what symbols or terms are used if they are clearly defined in the post. While signal processing is a subfield of electrical engineering, not everyone has that background, or they may be working in a different field that makes use of signal processing with different symbols or terminology. When notation or terminology is unclear it is of course correct to work towards making the post clear, by commenting, or editing as long as it does not change the meaning of the post. For example, deconvolution has a different meaning in signal processing and in machine learning, but the difference is very easy to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't bully&lt;/strong&gt; or harass. What can be bullying? Certainly downvoting just to discourage a poster from posting counts as bullying when it is not based on the content of each individual post. It is less clear if it is bullying if one checks more carefully the posts of a user when the posts of that user have previously warranted downvotes based on their content. I don't think that is bullying if one also upvotes whenever a check shows that the post is deserving of an upvote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;comment when downvoting&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise it cannot be assumed that the poster will know what exactly in the post warranted the downvote and may even think the downvote was not based on the merits of the question, which could be bullying. If you fear or anticipate a confrontation from engaging with the poster with your username visible, then yes, it may be best to just downvote instead of engaging. I admit I'm torn between conflict avoidance and engagement with OverLordGoldDragon — let this post act as a probe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't be rude or unwelcoming&lt;/strong&gt;. That mode of behavior &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/conduct&quot;&gt;is unacceptable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag rude or unwelcoming behavior from anyone.&lt;/strong&gt; A snarky comment from a veteran of the field? Flag it. I have started flagging rude and dismissing comments with a low threshold, in order to give a signal that such behavior is unacceptable and in order to reduce examples of such behavior that other users might copy thinking the behavior is acceptable. I may leave a comment addressing the user and explaining why the behavior is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="15347" LastEditorUserId="15347" LastEditDate="2023-03-13T06:52:42.193" LastActivityDate="2023-03-13T06:52:42.193" CommentCount="16" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This isn't college, work, or some other regulated environment with bottom-line incentives. SE to me is a platform where ideas can be exchanged honestly and openly, with limited moderation for civility. Moderation or attitude that shuts down any notion of offense just promotes walking on eggshells and, is frankly, &amp;quot;snowflake&amp;quot; stuff. Yes, niceness is important, but forced smiles is different.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't work here&lt;/strong&gt;. Some points are merely &amp;quot;nice to have&amp;quot; post improvements that I've no obligation for, nor should concern &amp;quot;respect&amp;quot;. Plenty or most of StackExchange users don't follow such &amp;quot;textbook guidelines&amp;quot;, and such motivations are understood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For emphasis, &lt;strong&gt;assume good faith&lt;/strong&gt; is my mantra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now by points, somewhat in order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Respect that users &lt;strong&gt;post and interact here on a fully voluntary basis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - I'm extremely aware of this, and will reference it throughout. I already restated it in (2).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some points are actually one-time offenses - the most recent case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Don't be rude&lt;/strong&gt; or verbally abusive.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - yes, that's usually breakdown of communication. To the extent the wording implies, I think it was a one-timer with me. More generally, I indeed &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;concentrate on the subject matter&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. However it has its place. As Jazzmaniac pointed, one can very much offend without resorting to &amp;quot;bad words&amp;quot;, and said offense can easily exceed those of bad words, or be their equivalent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Do not assume, state or imply that any individual community member or the whole community is stuck with a technical view&lt;/strong&gt; that prevents them from understanding a problem from a better technical view that you believe that you have. Someone who is well experienced in the subject matter may take such a statement as disrespect.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The problem is when my view is asserted and insisted invalid; that's them saying I'm stuck with a flawed view, no? I agree this'll lower respect, but respect goes both ways. That aside, there's a real epidemic of experts being &amp;quot;stuck in a view&amp;quot;, and it's unscientific and disrespectful to learners to not acknowledge it. Even so, if you dig into specifics, you should find my use reserved or blatantly provoked.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Explaining my motivations&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now separately, to address specific cases likely behind Olli's points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Respect that users &lt;strong&gt;post and interact here on a fully voluntary basis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - this happened once, and refers to comments to RBJ. It's a misunderstanding of our relationship: RBJ often made comments on my posts that asked for a response, with long term intent of convincing, in an intellectual-interest manner. My comment, with explicit request for response, was my way of elevating the topic's importance in same spirit, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;try to make use of the critique&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; ... &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;concentrate on the subject matter&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. This is about exchanges with AlexTP and TimWescott, and thinking hard, I couldn't find others (if there are any, very few) - and neither could Olli in now-deleted comments. So, each:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TimWescott: they've made a comment the day before that's since been &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qVjjR.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mod-edited&lt;/a&gt;, that's basically &amp;quot;you don't know your basics&amp;quot;. Combined with answers from Dan and Robert, I concluded Tim's comments were either not reading what I wrote or were nitpicking; upon closer inspection, I was mistaken and apologized, and edited the answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AlexTP - &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pQs3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;relevant excerpt&lt;/a&gt;: firstly, I have the right to disagree, criticism or not. My last comment however has greater context... the greater context. How would it be received if I, (supposing) not knowing calculus, complained about an answer using integrals being &amp;quot;unnecessary kinds of stuff&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;incomprehensible&amp;quot;? Point is, it's &amp;quot;socially&amp;quot; acceptable to give intuition second-class treatment, and to make statements that the author is responsible for the reader's lack of understanding - in ways that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done toward incomprehensible mathy answers. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; said mathy content was just as criticized, I'd take no issue at all - I have no issue with AlexTP telling me my writing doesn't cut it for him, I welcome it. However, &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; this context, it's as &lt;strong&gt;insulting to me&lt;/strong&gt; to say those things as it is to say someone's correct math proof is incorrect. Developing intuition involves lots of time and skill, and so is understanding it - it's its own field. I'm not playing professional here so I'll just go ahead and say it - AlexTP is stuck with an overly narrow technical viewpoint, and it is &lt;strong&gt;their problem&lt;/strong&gt;, not mine. It was the same with my renowned 80-year old EM-fields professor who said there's no intuition to Stokes' Theorem beyond textbook derivations, and I paid him thousands of dollars for this garbage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't tactically downvote&lt;/strong&gt; answers (&amp;quot;competing answers&amp;quot;) other than yours in order to improve the ranking of your answer.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I mostly agree, and as framed, I sort of never did. It's true that, on questions I did or did not answer, I'd downvote answers for no reason other than I believed they were overrated relative to others - but it wasn't to improve my own ranking specifically. It was also motivated by unfair downvoting toward me (as described in OP). Regardless, the number of such instances in grand total is 5 or less, and never toward posts with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=2&lt;/code&gt; net score.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Do not manipulate votes by deleting a downvoted post and reposting it.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; This happened once, for reasons I described in OP. If this was a &amp;quot;thing I do&amp;quot;, there'd be at least 3 other reposts. And as I commented, the downvoters were free to re-downvote; them never checking the page again after I made improvements isn't on me (it's in fact a cause).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For full context: it had a major edit, not just repost. To restate some things: 1) Case 2 is where I fixed flaws but downvotes were never retracted, and I didn't want hours of work trashed again, especially as I consider it an important post I'll refer to in the future, and it's a disservice to viewers; 2) &lt;code&gt;-4&lt;/code&gt; was because of my &amp;quot;garbage&amp;quot; comment, not substance of the post.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What I've been doing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you may not know I've done:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fat32 called for my ban over my challenging of some Fourier theory; I've said nothing to warrant this - here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0atKx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;full thread&lt;/a&gt; up to it.
