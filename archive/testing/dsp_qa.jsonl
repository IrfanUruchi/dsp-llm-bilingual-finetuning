At best, this is... better than nothing. At worst, it's just noise. <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/\">Here are some guidelines for writing tag wiki excerpts:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>The excerpt is the elevator pitch for the tag.</strong> You only have ~500 plain text characters for the excerpt, so don’t feel obligated to cover everything in it! Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences.</li>\n  <li><strong>Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized.</strong> The “email” tag, for example, does <em>not</em> need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone.</li>\n  <li><strong>Concentrate on what a tag means to your community.</strong> For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail, as that would be more appropriate for webapps.stackexchange.com.</li>\n  <li><strong>Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag.</strong> In other words, <em>what kinds of questions should have this tag?</em> Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions, so if we don’t provide proper guidance on which questions <em>need</em> this tag, they won’t get tagged at all, rendering the tag excerpt moot. Think of it as a sales pitch: in a room full of tags screaming “pick me!”, what would convince a question asker to select your tag?</li>\n  <li><strong>Some tags are common knowledge.</strong> Most tags require a bit of explanation in the excerpt, even if it’s only 3 or 4 words. But if the tag is common knowledge — that is, if you <em>walked up to any random person on the street and said the tag word to them</em>, and they would know what you were talking about — then don’t bother explaining the tag at all. Stick to usage of the tag within your community in the excerpt.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n"}

This is a very bad idea when a site is new and budding, because of a few reasons as below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>With all the initial activity and excitement, people are overenthusiastic in shipping things off to other sites. This might not actually be the right thing to do because we're still defining what's on topic for us and to what extent questions marginally outside our bounds will be tolerated. Also, we need questions!</li>\n<li><p>Just because a question is more math/programming related doesn't necessarily mean it's on-topic there or a good quality question. The community has to grow to learn and understand which questions should be moved and which shouldn't. The golden rule of migration is \"don't migrate crap\".</p></li>\n<li><p>You can close questions with <em>just 1 rep</em> in private beta. This means that a user, who has <em>no understanding</em> of the SE system, can vote to migrate a question elsewhere, possibly flooding that site with questions that are possibly off-topic there.</p></li>\n<li><p>From what I've observed from other sites, a good number of the users who are active in the private beta and initial phase of public beta never make it to the end as dedicated users. We don't want good questions to be incorrectly shipped off by a small group of people w/o mod intervention, especially when the consensus of the larger community is yet unknown.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some sites never make it <em>out of beta</em>, so providing a migration path to this site might result in certain questions dying when the site is shut down.

If the questions already have an accepted answer (like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8213360/matlab-barcode-scanner\">this one</a>), then it may not make a lot of sense to migrate in terms of getting better answers, but they would still help to boost the content on this site (and raise our #of questions rating, as well as possibly traffic). </p>\n\n<p>What should our policy be?</p>\n", "response": "<h3>What makes a good on-topic question?</h3>\n<p>I envision this site to be a place for people to bring their research problems (from any field) that involve signal/image processing and get solutions or suggestions for them. There are several inter-disciplinary questions and the recent one on <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/675/find-the-stomata-in-a-plant-microscopy-image\">finding stomata in plant microscopy images</a> comes to mind as a good example. The question on <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/374/river-detection-in-text\">river detection in text</a> is yet another great example of someone bringing their problem from a completely different field and asking the experts here if it could be done (and it got great answers!).</p>\n<p>Another good use of this site is in understanding algorithms used in certain applications (e.g. <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/688/whats-the-algorithm-behind-photoshops-black-and-white-adjustment-layer\">algorithm used in photoshop's B &amp; W adjustment layer</a> and explanations on fundamental but often misunderstood concepts (e.g., <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/432/how-are-time-resolution-and-signal-bandwidth-related\">How are time resolution and frequency bandwidth related</a>). I really, <em>really</em> dislike the &quot;most lucid explanation to teach your grandmother to use wavelets&quot; kind of questions and I hope we don't see them very often. However, that's a different beast to tackle.</p>\n<h3>What should be our policy?</h3>\n<p>Ideally, algorithms, ideas and approaches should be first and foremost and <strong>not</strong> code in language X. I mean, the answerer can use whatever language they feel they're comfortable in (e.g., the river detection question had answers in MATLAB, python and Mathematica), but the focus of the question should not be an explicit &quot;give be the codez in X&quot;. Questions like show me how in any language and I'll work it out myself are also most welcome here.</p>\n<p>Explicit requests for code in language X should be <strong>off-topic</strong>. The primary reason for not allowing questions that simply want code in X is because then we'll get overrun by which ever language is most commonly used in the particular field, and other folks who are more inclined towards theory and algorithm development part of it might be put off and leave. I can easily see MATLAB/openCV questions just flooding us if we opened the gates (in fact, we get a few such questions which you don't see because they are either promptly migrated or nuked right here).</p>\n<h3>Can we have the best of both worlds?</h3>\n<p>Coming to the question you linked to (electrophoresis gel), I in fact did comment on it and asked the OP if he was looking for code or approaches. He did seem pretty clueless, and looked like he wanted some code to solve his issue right away, so I left it at that. However, barring that, it fits very well with our site's scope and is a good example of the use of image processing in diverse fields. Ultimately, diversity is the key to our growth.</p>\n<p>So I decided to try something different. I requested that the question be left on Stack Overflow for a couple of days (a moderator did talk to me about your flag) and once the code part has been solved, I will request migration here, where users can provide an explanation of how to go about it in general. This way, the OP gets his problem solved, and we have a good resource for our site. I realize that our users might not have gotten the head start that Stack Overflow users would've gotten in terms of votes, and so I'm willing to put a bounty on every such question that I request for migration (only new questions), and does not have an already reasonable answer.</p>\n<p>I do not know if this will work or if it's a good idea, but I'm willing to give it a try. Since this was less than a day ago, I didn't have the time to bring it here as a meta post, but it's good that you did! I'd appreciate feedback on this idea.</p>\n<h3>A final word on migrations...</h3>\n<p>Please do not request for migration of old questions unless if it's really, <em>really</em> off-topic on Stack Overflow (or elsewhere) and <em>a very good question</em> for our site. Borderline and meager questions should be left alone where ever they are. If the OP of the post is not around anymore (greyed out) or hasn't visited in 2 years, please leave them where they are. If there's an old and interesting question but not migration worthy in its current form (either because of poor details in the question or crappy answers), please just re-ask the question here in a better form and in a manner that makes it on-topic for us.</p>\n"}

However, the edits are not substantial as you claim, and there's practically no effort put into it. Here's a bit more to the story, just so people don't think that you've been grossly wronged.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, you started flooding the queue with edits to tag wikis and excerpts, and you merely <strong>copied content from Wikipedia without any attribution whatsoever</strong>. You copied just enough to make it look believable that you wrote it, yet not too much to make anyone doubt it. Since you passed them off as your own, a few users who approved them were tricked into believing that they were original and were in fact impressed that someone took the time to write them all. Nearly 100 edits had passed before I saw your fresh batch of edits sitting in the queue the next morning and it so happened that I was familiar with a few of the wikipedia articles you copied from, and I immediately recognized that it was plagiarized. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Plagiarism is not something we condone</strong> and we're not in middle school anymore to not know that it's wrong. Moderators datageist and I had to spend nearly a full hour trying to fix your plagiarized content by searching for the sources and attributing them, and datageist spent a further few hours later that day fixing your earlier edits. This is not a good use of our time, and all of this was brought about because of your plagiarism. You should've really been suspended for it, but instead, I was a bit more forgiving and pulled you over in chat and told you to attribute sources and you agreed.</p>\n\n<p>Your next batch of edits had sources dumped in the end, and we did approve them, with some fixes. What really flipped me off was <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/201\">this suggested edit</a> which you've conveniently linked in your question. Specifically (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] from different times, or from different viewpoints.<strong>[1]</strong> It is used in computer vision [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You couldn't even bother to remove the <code>[1]</code> from Wikipedia's citation! That's how lazy and unsubstantial these edits are. It does not take any effort to copy two lines from Wikipedia and when even that is done sloppily, I see no other option other than to reject. </p>\n\n<p>These aren't good tag wiki entries either. Tag wikis are <strong>not</strong> proxies for Wikipedia. It probably takes me the same number of clicks to get to a tag wiki article as it does to a wikipedia article and I get less information! </p>\n\n<p><strong>A tag wiki is supposed to educate users about the kind of questions you expect in the tag and perhaps what not to ask and if additional tags need to be used.</strong> The <a href=\"https://cooking.stackexchange.com/tags/culinary-uses/info\">culinary uses</a> tag on cooking.SE is a good example. It tells you what kind of questions use the tag, what kind of questions are not appropriate and has some tips on answering. <a href=\"https://gardening.stackexchange.com/tags/apples/info\">apples</a> and <a href=\"https://gardening.stackexchange.com/tags/identification/info\">identification</a> tags from <a href=\"https://gardening.stackexchange.com/\">gardening.SE</a> are other examples that come to mind. If a tag becomes extremely popular, the tag could have its own collection of FAQ and tutorials like the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala/info\">scala</a> tag on Stack Overflow. However, we have a long way to go before we get there.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying that the first iteration of the tag wiki needs to be perfect. However, I do think it needs to be more substantial than copy-pasta. The mistake was that we, the users who approved, fell into the trap of <em>something is better than nothing</em>. However, we'd rather have nothing than sloppy copies. Henceforth, I'll reject all cut-n-pastes, even if attributed. We can do better than that.</p>\n"}

Further more, there will be no guarantees of an answer in that particular language, i.e., if someone knows a good algorithm and explains it via Mathematica/MATLAB/python for an OpenCV question, then it should be fine. It's up to the OP to translate it (they can always go to Stack Overflow for help with that). I think this is a very reasonable position and will help foster a language-agnostic culture, instead of the language-free culture we've been having up until now. Some examples of good, recent questions like this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/864/surface-detection\">Surface detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/712/measuring-length-of-dna-fibers-from-an-image-of-single-molecules/713#713\">Measuring length of DNA fibers from an image of single molecules</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/675/find-the-stomata-in-a-plant-microscopy-image/681#681\">Find the stomata in a plant microscopy image</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both cases, the OP was looking for a solution in a particular language, but were both happy to learn of a possible approaches in different languages and I presume, are working on translating whatever helped.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Coming to your examples, the first question should not have been asked here. It was originally  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8315944/how-to-provide-region-of-interest-roi-for-edge-detection-and-corner-detection\">asked on Stack Overflow</a>, and Endolith, a good contributor to this site recommended dsp.se. However, I won't fault him for that, because the SO version looked more like a conceptual question, which would've been a good fit, whereas the OP decided to dump his code here. The answer barely passes the minimum characters required. I'll ship it back to SO sometime soon.</p>\n<p>The second one though, is very much on-topic. Note the last line: <em>&quot;The result inverse contains complex values, that confuses me.&quot;</em> That is the crux of the question. The rest is just to support the story.

Another place to look for posts with recent close votes is in the <a href=\"https://dsp.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;daterange=last30days\">tools page</a> (you need at least 2k rep).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I do monitor these queues, but I generally don't vote to close unless it has 3-4 close votes already (or if it is extremely terrible). This is because my vote, as a moderator, is binding and I'd like to see some community effort/agreement in closing. In the early days of this site, I was more active in closing duplicates and slamming shut the localized/off-topic and non-constructive questions to guide the site (and new users) when it's young. Back then, we only had two 2k+ users (myself and Jason), whereas now we are over a year old and have 11 users with 2k+ rep (and access to tools), and about 50 or so with the privilege to close, so there is no need for me or the other mods to be as proactive as before. If everyone pitched in a little (posts also need editing), then things will move a lot smoother and faster :)</p>\n\n<p>So please, make use of the review queue. If you see something that needs fixing/editing, please do so. Something doesn't belong here? Vote to close. If you find something that is old and needs to be closed, but will not get much attention because of its age, then flag it. </p>\n"}

That is because I am trying to avoid questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>&quot;How to calculate STFT in Haskell?&quot;</em>.</p>\n<p>Even if the OP would get the answer, it presumably won't help other people looking for implementation in different programming languages. We will start getting duplicates of the exact same question in various flavours. What's more, chances of getting a good answer are lower - there are not so many people here that know Haskell. That is why we are trying to make answers language-agnostic, as much as possible. It's better to &quot;teach the man how to fish&quot;, and provide him with enough theory and explanation, so he can implement it in any language.\nThere are obviously some exceptions, and people tend to give examples in languages like: <em>Python</em>, <em>MATLAB</em>, <em>C</em>/<em>C++</em> and <em>R</em>. That would be the case when problem is simple enough, and program itself can be treated as a &quot;working pseudo-code&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;<em>Why this FIR implementation doesn't work?</em>&quot; (followed by 10's or 100's lines of code)</p>\n<p>We are not focusing here on debugging someone's code. Such questions are far way better suited for Stack Overflow. Many DSP SE people have accounts on SO, so that DSP community over there is big enough to help someone.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your question kind of falls into the first category. You have a specific DSP/Machine Learning problem that you are trying to solve. In order to make it more suitable for DSP SE, you could state the problem differently. More precisely: &quot;<em>How to detect number syllables in audio recordings</em>&quot;? You shouldn't ask explicitly about <em>R</em> implementation. In my opinion, focus first on getting the right algorithm, then it should be a piece of cake to implement it.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I don't think that searching for peaks will be robust enough. You would be better of doing some sort of LPC analysis which will give lower dimensionality of your feature vector.</p>\n"}

I am well aware of the goal of DA (Dimensional Analysis) to achieve conceptual harmony to the natural physical constants (and approaching this goal is contrary to integrity checking of equations).</p>\n<p>My objection is to RB-J's role as an acolyte insisting that DA is &quot;the only and true way&quot; (and his combative manner).  Particularly since it was formalized by a &quot;standards committee&quot; (those with experience, insert running jokes here).  Whether rotation should be a dimension was and probably still is a big issue to wank over.  DA's definitions of &quot;Dimension&quot; and &quot;Unit&quot; are the pedantic ones and I would think minority ones.  The carrying-the-units/math/common man definitions are much more down-to-earth (more concrete than abstract).  A dimension is a coordinate in a vector space, and a unit defines a measure along that coordinate.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to use DA to find &quot;meaning in Physics&quot;, fine.  But if you are looking for integrity checking to prevent calculation errors in formulas, you aren't using the best tool.  The lander crashed because &quot;velocity&quot; wasn't defined in units.  And I challenge you to assert the following equation is nonsense with the carry the units definition of a unit:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$ 2 \\frac{\\text{Semicircles}}{\\text{Circle}} \\cdot 1 \\frac{\\text{Circle}}{\\text{Cycle}}  \\cdot \\pi \\frac{\\text{Radians}}{\\text{Semicircle}} = 2 \\pi \\frac{\\text{Radians}}{\\text{Cycle}} $$</span></p>\n<p>Two kilos of apples is different than two kilos of oranges, so if you are weighing them, I kilo of apples weighs a kilo (conversion factor), and I kilo of oranges weighs a kilo (conversion factor), so you can add them (common units).   Note, no need to mention dimension.  If you are counting them, well you have so many apples (units) and so many oranges (units).  If you want to compare items of different units, you have to convert them to the same scale (units) using what is known as a &quot;Value Function&quot;.  The value function can be as simple as multiplying by a conversion factor (even if that factor is numerically 1).  &quot;Pricing&quot; is the most common value function there is.  Yes, carrying the units was developed mainly for use in &quot;rate problems&quot; to keep your units straight and it works well.</p>\n<p>The difference between carrying the units vs DA is like weak typing vs strong typing in programming languages.</p>\n<p>So, deepster/fancy question du jour:  If the Universe didn't exist, would the values of <span class=\"math-container\">$\\pi$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$e$</span> still exist?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I hope everybody agrees that this is a definitional issue, so I'd like to attempt to take the &quot;my definition is right&quot; aspect out of this, and shift to the implications of accepting either definition as the correct one.  To do so, I'm going to introduce two working definitions with the intention that the scope not exceed the extent of the this question and its answers, and that the nomenclature not favor one over the other.</p>\n<p>t-units = Traditional units, using the root meaning of &quot;one&quot;, capable of any level of specificity by the act of naming.</p>\n<p>s-units = Standardized units, as defined by the various ISO standards or other governing bodies</p>\n<p>There should be no disagreement about the following statements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>s-units are a subset of t-units</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In t-units, the answer to the title question is cycles per sample</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In s-units, the answer to the title question is unitless</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Converting from t-units to s-units can be, and often is, lossy</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Three questions arise from these observations:</p>\n<p>A.  Should t-units be stamped out?</p>\n<p>B.  Was it the intent of standardization to weaken the integrity validation capability of Dimensional/Unit Analysis?</p>\n<p>C.  How does this relate to &quot;political correctness&quot; in general?</p>\n<p>Indeed, this is a pedantic (in a non-perjorative way) exercise, done in pedantic style.  That's the point of it being placed in Meta and tagged with &quot;discussion&quot;.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Okay, everybody can see the setup, right?</p>\n<p>Check-mate.</p>\n<p>Observation 4 validates Question B.  Question B is a yes/no question.  So what can be answered?</p>\n<p>No, it is an unintended consequence.  Okay, you admit that it is detrimental to integrity checking.</p>\n<p>Yes, it is intentional as it keeps things simple [A strong aversion to complexity has repeatedly been expressed here] and any loss of functionality is a small price to pay for the greater good of the benefits of standardization.</p>\n<p>In either case, it is clear that a loss of validity has occurred.  Therefore the answer to Question A has to be a firm no.  Furthermore, those who attempt to do so are firmly in the wrong and should desist immediately, starting with RB-J.</p>\n<p>Question C takes us to a whole 'nuther level.
